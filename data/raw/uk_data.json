I noticed that the last few days he literally runs away from the dreamies and smacks his lips a lot (sign of nausea with cats) He is still very cuddly but just seems sad??? They have a few more cats and a dog and do seem like they are a pretty busy household so maybe they haven’t noticed. My kitty recently got diagnosed with pancreatitis and is still struggling with it so maybe i am just extra cautious but how rude it is going to be if i just knock on the door and let them know i worry about their cat? I don’t want to sound like i am implying they are being neglectful etc but i really do worry about the kitty. ",

She talks to them at the school gates etc, but she feels ignored unless she initiates the conversation. \n\nShe’s formed genuine friendships with Indian, Indonesian, African, Chinese, Latin American and so on, but she really struggles with connecting with British women and has commented that she feels it’s very cliquey. She’s even said to me the other day that other than me, that she feels British people seem to look down on her because she’s clearly a foreigner with an accent. \n\nI don’t want her to feel like this whole thing is getting her down, so does anyone had any advice? Honestly I can see where she’s coming from as I’m British and also haven’t made a single new friend for probably about 12 years now. I didn’t realise we were so difficult to connect with! \n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello all, throwaway account.\n\nUnfortunately I have fallen on hard times and can do with all the extra income / savings possible. I live in the centre of town and work 9 hour days at my office job Monday to Friday. I have an okay salary, and with a few more years hard work in my current sector I should hopefully find myself being in a much better position financially.  \n\nI have sadly found myself in debt from my time as a university student. I have struggled to repay my overdrafts and currently stand at minus £2000. I am able to make it through each month paying my rent, bills and feeding myself. But the £2000 debt doesn’t ever seem to go down as I’m ultimately living paycheck to paycheck. My social life has also declined massively with me being as frugal as possible with my spending, which doesn’t make me feel great when I see my peers having fun and living, but I get a sense a lot of it is from their ‘banks of mum and dad’.\n\nWithout getting into it, I’m aware it’s my own fault that I worked up this debt. I haven’t had to worry about it so much as it was in a student overdraft account it was interest free - I now find myself at the point where I will begin to be charged interest on this in a years time and I am flying into a panic. I live away from family and I’m not in position where I can ask them for ANY help whatsoever.\n\nAbout my expenses: With regard to transport, I’ve never been able to afford a car so I use public transport to commute to Salford and this is comp’d by my company already. Work are also sponsoring me to complete extra courses and qualifications which will further help me with my career, but should I leave the company I would have to pay them the full cost of these qualifications, which currently stands around £2100 if I understand it correctly. I have also recently moved flats to one with a lower rent and I am tied into this for another year at least, so the option of moving somewhere else or changing jobs would be extremely difficult.\n\nThe advice I am seeking is what to do when you find yourself in this situation, I am young and still trying to figure out the real world. Are there any good, realistic, ways to make a bit of extra money on the side to help? How can I further save money when living in the centre of Manchester? \n\nAny help (guidance wise, I don’t want money from strangers) would be greatly appreciated. \n\nApologies if this is a bit depressing or tiresome to read. All the best\n\nEdit: had a few comments about ‘why’ I live in the city centre. I live in a tiny room in a flat share where I pay £450 a month (we don’t split the rent evenly due to the sizes of the rooms)",

Men's Sheds tackle social isolation and provide a safe and friendly environment to get together with others, learn new skills and make things or repair things brought into the Shed by members of the community. They often help local projects by making things that are needed such as planters for a gardening project or benches for local parks. It's not all woodwork though and our Men's Shed is directed by its members.\n\n[https://www.visitmanchester.com/event/mens-shed-%40-gorton-monastery/98947101/](https://www.visitmanchester.com/event/mens-shed-%40-gorton-monastery/98947101/)",

It's awesome to see most people are still mad for it! \n\nHad a good walk down memory lane visiting the spots I used to haunt as a teenager. Some are still there, some not. \n\nSometimes it was just flat out uncanny. Went to see the spot where I used to work, it was not only gone, it led into Afflecks Palace. This spun me out because that's not where Afflecks Pallace is...figured out they knocked it through to the other side of the block. Inside though,  it's exactly the same as as I remember! Same place I got my first piercing.  Same vibe, 100%. \n\nA lot of the old Victorian back streets have gone.  They were old and looking derelict when I was young.  Probably inevitable. They are replaced by towering sky scrapers of glass and steel. That's great...except that's what all major cities are slowly becoming.  \n\nI returned to the UK from Australia with stops in Singapore for a few days and Dubai. Both cities,  the centre was all towering glass and steel buildings.  This is progress,  it's attractive,  but it's the same world wide. \n\nThe people though,  still the same great people they allways were. A guy who worked for metrolink asked if I was OK even though he was clearly off duty. I was just admiring some posters but maybe I looked confused or strung out. The fact he bothered to check on a total stranger...that's Manchester.  A guy fell off his wheelchair,  5 people instantly came to his assistance.  I was on my way over but there was instantly nearer people who were happy to help. That's Manchester.  \n\nMarket Street had an Islamic stall, a Christian stall and a Hari Krishna stall. There was a communist protest and in Picadilly gardens a dude busking on a full drum kit. Couldn't be more proud to call myself a Manc. \n\nJust don't loose your soul to progress and look like every other major city!",

Although maybe not the hour and a half on public transport it'll take us to get there...\n\nETA: GP call went well, thankfully she was really nice! She thinks I definitely have some symptoms and is going to put me forward for an assessment (on the understanding that it's a long wait) but I have to write a personal statement sometime in the next week, so that'll take a few days to work on.",

Cold, damp towel + neck fan will bring a body temp down pretty quickly. My husband likes these, and they’re less than £20 https://amzn.eu/d/1fQ9zmu  for the fan and also less than £20 for a four-pack of cooling towels https://amzn.eu/d/iIU16cc\n\nAfter a cold shower, mostly dry off, then completely soak and wring out a towel, lay down, lay the wet towel over yourself, and point a large fan at you. So nice. I use the four pack of towels linked above to basically wrap myself like a mummy and lay in front of a fan.\n\nI also like the spray bottles with fan attachments.

Yeah, they're shit and need to stop \n\n\nBut screaming babies is just a thing we all need to bear occasionally. No one wants it, least of all the parents, but there is really very little you can do in the circumstances of a crowded tube for example to stop it when it's happening.\n\n\nTry and grow up a little and accept this",

To provide impartial news and information to help people understand and engage with the world around them\n\nThe BBC should provide duly accurate and impartial news, current affairs and factual programming to build people’s understanding of all parts of the United Kingdom and of the wider world. Its content should be provided to the highest editorial standards. It should offer a range and depth of analysis and content not widely available from other United Kingdom news providers, using the highest calibre presenters and journalists, and championing freedom of expression, so that all audiences can engage fully with major local, regional, national, United Kingdom and global issues and participate in the democratic process, at all levels, as active and informed citizens.\n\n2. To support learning for people of all ages\n\nThe BBC should help everyone learn about different subjects in ways they will find accessible, engaging, inspiring and challenging. The BBC should provide specialist educational content to help support learning for children and teenagers across the United Kingdom. It should encourage people to explore new subjects and participate in new activities through partnerships with educational, sporting and cultural institutions.\n\n3. To show the most creative, highest quality and distinctive output and services\n\nThe BBC should provide high-quality output in many different genres and across a range of services and platforms which sets the standard in the United Kingdom and internationally. Its services should be distinctive from those provided elsewhere and should take creative risks, even if not all succeed, in order to develop fresh approaches and innovative content.\n\n4. To reflect, represent and serve the diverse communities of all of the United Kingdom’s nations and regions and, in doing so, support the creative economy across the United Kingdom\n\nThe BBC should reflect the diversity of the United Kingdom both in its output and services. In doing so, the BBC should accurately and authentically represent and portray the lives of the people of the United Kingdom today, and raise awareness of the different cultures and alternative viewpoints that make up its society. It should ensure that it provides output and services that meet the needs of the United Kingdom’s nations, regions and communities. The BBC should bring people together for shared experiences and help contribute to the social cohesion and wellbeing of the United Kingdom. In commissioning and delivering output the BBC should invest in the creative economies of each of the nations and contribute to their development.\n\n5. To reflect the United Kingdom, its culture and values to the world\n\nThe BBC should provide high-quality news coverage to international audiences, firmly based on British values of accuracy, impartiality, and fairness. Its international services should put the United Kingdom in a world context, aiding understanding of the United Kingdom as a whole, including its nations and regions where appropriate. It should ensure that it produces output and services which will be enjoyed by people in the United Kingdom and globally.",

About 20 fans turned up to support him in the public gallery, with two saying \"we love you Chris\" as he left the court.\n\nProsecutors have previously said the alleged victim, Abraham Diaw, was standing at the bar of Soho's Tape nightclub on 19 February 2023 when Mr Brown struck him several times with a bottle.\n\nThe singer was arrested at the five-star Lowry hotel in Salford, Greater Manchester, in May, after returning to the UK to prepare for a European tour.\n\nHe was held in custody for almost a week, before being released after agreeing to pay a £5m security fee to the court.\n\nA security fee is a financial guarantee to ensure a defendant returns to court. Mr Brown could be asked to forfeit the money if he breaches bail conditions, which were kept in place at Friday's hearing.\n\nUnder those conditions, Mr Brown must live at an address in the UK while awaiting trial, and was ordered to surrender his passport to police.\n\nHowever, he is allowed to honour his Breezy Bowl XX world tour dates by surrendering his passport but getting it back when he needs to travel to the gigs.\n\nHe has played a string of stadium and arena shows across the UK and Europe in recent weeks, ending in Paris last weekend. The North American leg of his tour is due to start later this month and end on 18 October.\n\nThe next court hearing has been scheduled for 24 October.\n\nMr Brown is one of the biggest stars in US R&B, with two Grammy Awards, and 19 top 10 singles in the UK - including hits like Turn Up The Music, Freaky Friday, With You and Don't Wake Me Up.\n\nHis co-defendant Omololu Akinlolu, a 39-year-old American who performs under the name HoodyBaby, also pleaded not guilty to causing actual bodily harm. He previously entered a not guilty plea to the charge of attempted grievous bodily harm.",

England played 53 Archerless matches.\n\nThe 'void' Ashes, the birth of Bazball. Retirements of Stuart Broad and James Anderson, memorable wins in Rawalpindi and Hyderabad. The Jonny Bairstow stumping. The beginning and end of Ollie Robinson's Test career.\n\nIt has been a monumental collective effort to get Archer back in England whites, but only the man himself will know everything it has taken. The setbacks and heartbreak, lonely days in the gym and solo net sessions. One-dayers, T20s and Barbados club cricket.\n\nGradually, a fanciful dream became a reality. A return to red-ball cricket with Sussex and a place in the England squad for the second Test against India, all building to the third Test at Lord's.\n\nWhen Archer was confirmed in the England XI the day before the game began, he prepared by bowling spin - right- and left-arm - in the nets.\n\nA rare Ben Stokes choice to bat first meant a wait to get the ball in hand. On a boiling Friday, Archer looked genuinely disappointed when his batting was cut short by the genius of Jasprit Bumrah.",

Winn denied the allegations and said she was taking legal advice.\n\nOn Wednesday, she posted a more extensive statement, responding in detail to each of the claims made in the Observer's article.\n\nThe newspaper said it had spoken to medical experts who were \"sceptical\" that Moth had corticobasal degeneration (CBD), given his lack of acute symptoms and apparent ability to reverse them via walking.\n\nIn response, Winn provided documents that appeared to confirm he had been diagnosed with CBD. One letter suggested Moth may have an \"atypical form\" of the condition, or perhaps \"an even more unusual disorder\".\n\nThe Observer also said the couple had lost their home after Winn took out a loan to cover money she had been accused of stealing from a previous employer, and not in a bad business deal as Winn described in her book.\n\nIn her statement, Winn said the two cases were separate. She stood by her description of how the couple came to lose their home and wrote in detail about an investment in a property portfolio that left the couple liable for large sums of money.\n\nHowever, in relation to the Observer's accusation that she had defrauded her previous employer of £64,000, Winn acknowledged making \"mistakes\" earlier in her career, and said it had been a pressured time.\n\n\"Any mistakes I made during the years in that office, I deeply regret, and I am truly sorry,\" she said.\n\nBut she added the case had been settled between her and her ex-employer on a \"non-admissions basis\", and although she was questioned by police, she was not charged.\n\nWinn also said the couple did not have any outstanding debts, and clarified that a house in France that the Observer said they also owned was \"an uninhabitable ruin in a bramble patch\", which an estate agent had advised was not worth selling.\n\nThe Salt Path has sold more than two million copies since its publication in March 2018, and a film adaptation starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs was released earlier this year.\n\nWinn has written two sequels, The Wild Silence and Landlines, which also focus on themes of nature, wild camping, homelessness and walking.",

      "text": "Jet lag products\n\nJet lag can cause fatigue, disorientation and irritability. There’s an array of products claiming to help weary travellers adjust to new time zones – but which of them really work?\n\nDr Ben Edwards, from Liverpool John Moores University, explains how jet lag is a “rhythm disturbance” to your body clock, which takes light as its main cue. In 2007, medical journal The Lancet published a paper on jet lag that recommended the best times to get light at your destination to mitigate its effects. The most important advice is not to try and shift too many hours in one go – if you look at the morning sun at your destination, but your body clock still thinks it’s the middle of the night, it can get confused and think you’re staying up late rather getting up early.\n\nThere are a range of supplements suggested. Vitamin C, magnesium, B vitamins and melatonin are included in a jet lag ‘prevention system’ called FlyKitt. But all of the vitamins and minerals can also be obtained from a balanced diet. And “for people who normally sleep well, melatonin doesn't improve their sleep in the new time zone, and it doesn't increase adjustment,” says Ben.\n\nYou can also get Iintravenous vitamin drips for before or after your trip for anywhere from £150 to £350. But the main benefit of these is preventing dehydration – easily solved by drinking water – and they can be dangerous. Equally a device called the HumidiFlyer mask that claims to “trap the expired moisture from your breath” to combat dry cabin air might help with fatigue, but won’t prevent jet lag.\n\nMotion sickness remedies\n\nTravel sickness can really put a dampener on a much longed-for holiday, and make cruises a massive no-go. Professor of Applied Psychology at the School for Social Sciences, Professor John Golding, explains how the dizziness and nausea is caused by a “sensory mismatch” between your inner ears, your eyes and your body.\n\nTrials indicate that acupressure wristbands, which claim to prevent motion sickness, are not much different from a placebo. Although this in itself can be useful, says John. “If someone has tried these wristbands and it has helped them, the advice would probably be to keep using them.”\n\nThe common active ingredients in motion sickness pills are cinnarizine and hyoscine hydrobromide (aka scopolamine). “They have similar effectiveness,” says John. “There’ve been some very, very large Royal Navy trials at sea to show that.” Absorption times do vary, so check this before you travel.\n\nThere’s also a hyoscine patch that you stick behind your ear. This contains five times the dose, and can last for up to three days, but is a lot more expensive and the onset time could be around eight hours, so apply well in advance. “It's highly effective,” says Andrew, and “the chance of having side effects like drowsiness are less.”\n\nControlled breathing can help, but by far the most effective – and free – anti-motion sickness method is to train yourself out of it, says the expert. “You have to have many, many exposures to the motion stimulus.” Could be time to book that cruise after all…\n\nHay fever treatments\n\nFor hay fever sufferers, the arrival of summer can mean a runny nose, congestion and itchy, streaming eyes caused by an immune response to pollen. Antihistamine tablets can help to relieve symptoms – but which ones work best?\n\nThe first generation of these tablets includes chlorphenamine, branded as Piriton. This may cause drowsiness. Newer treatments such as cetirizine (hydrochloride), loratadine, fexofenadine and acrivastine are generally less likely to cause sleepiness. Cetirizine is noted to work faster but loratadine’s effects last longer.\n\nCosts vary wildly and it can be worth swerving the big brands. Benadryl Allergy Relief costs 41p per tablet, and the recommended dose is three a day. In contrast, it can be as little as 26p a tablet for Claritin, with Asda’s own brand of loratadine coming in at 7p a tablet!\n\nThere is also a plethora of nasal sprays on the market. Clinical director of Allergy UK, Margaret Kelman, says that the steroid-based sprays are particularly effective at relieving congestion whereas the antihistamine sprays are good for itchy, runny noses. Saline sprays help by clearing out allergens.\n\n“All medications are metabolised differently,” says Margaret. “I wouldn't say any one particular antihistamine is better than the other. It just depends on what works for you.”\n\nThe information contained in this article was correct at the time of broadcast on 17 April 2025.",

      "title": "Panting, gular fluttering and sploots: how Britain’s animals try to keep cool",
      "text": "With the UK bracing for its third heatwave of the summer, 2025 is on course to be a record-breaking year for temperature. As people retreat into paddling pools and beneath the breeze of pedestal fans, a quieter and less visible struggle is playing out across the country’s fields, forests and hedgerows. So how are Britain’s animals weathering the heat?\n\nFrom cows and cats to herons, horses and even earthworms, each species has evolved its own tactics for staying cool – some more effective than others. But as extreme heat events become more frequent and intense, scientists are beginning to question the longer-term resilience of UK wildlife, and what we can do to help.\n\nUnlike humans, most species have not evolved the ability to sweat. But dogs pant – as do some birds, including blackbirds. Others, including pigeons and herons, rapidly vibrate the bones and muscles in their throats to expose moist membranes to the air and dissipate heat, a technique called gular fluttering.\n\nEarthworms seek refuge deep underground and “aestivate” – slowing down their metabolisms and sleeping out hot, dry periods. Snails aestivate in their shells. Squirrels “sploot” – splaying themselves out in a pancake posture to dump heat into the ground. And although cats do not sweat through their skin, they can do so through their paw pads. They also lick their paws and fur to enhance cooling.\n\nView image in fullscreen A squirrel splooting on a branch. This pancake posture is used to dump heat into the ground. Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PA\n\nSuch strategies can be costly though. “Some animals exhibit behaviours like panting when they go into heat stress, which is an important way for the body to try and regulate itself. But if you’re panting, it’s harder to pick up food and feed yourself adequately,” said Prof Alex Thornton at the University of Exeter. “Lots of animals will go and hide in the shade, which might save them from some of the bad effects of the heat, but it also means they’re not out finding food or mates, which can have negative consequences if that heat is prolonged.”\n\nHigh temperatures also make animals – and humans – temporarily more stupid. “Just as if I asked you to do an exam and I cranked up the thermostat to 40 degrees, you’d probably do a lot worse than you might otherwise, we find similar sorts of things in animals,” said Thornton. “I’ve been doing work with Australian colleagues on some desert animals, where we can show that even in wild conditions, if they’re heat stressed their cognitive performance really drops. That’s a big problem because animals use their cognitive abilities to deal with environmental change, to track food, and so on.”\n\nView image in fullscreen High temperatures inhibit the growth of new neurons in a fruit fly’s brain. Photograph: vasekk/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nEvidence from laboratory creatures suggests there may be developmental consequences too. For instance, in fruit flies, high temperatures inhibit the growth of new neurons in the brain. “If baby flies grow up under very high heat, they end up with smaller mushroom bodies – the part of the insect brain that controls learning,” said Thornton. In humans too, evidence increasingly suggests that prolonged exposure to temperatures above 30C during pregnancy or early life can affect the growth of foetuses and infants up to the age of two.\n\nProlonged heat stress can reduce farm animals’ fertility and increase susceptibility to disease. Cattle are particularly affected by heat.\n\n“Our northern European-bred cattle are very happy in cooler temperatures. But when they are hot, we notice this bunching behaviour, where they stand very close together,” said Dr Zoe Barker, an agricultural scientist at the University of Reading.\n\nOne theory is that bunching in the shade helps them to stay cool – but indoor-housed cattle do it too. Another is that they are bunching towards better ventilation or trying to protect themselves from flies. Alternatively, “they could have got so stressed, that their herd instinct is to bunch together”, said Barker.\n\nShe and colleagues at the universities of Essex, Cardiff and Anglia Ruskin are studying this phenomenon, because it does not seem to be very good for cattle. “When they bunch, the individual animals get warmer because you’ve got these massive radiators sticking themselves next to one another, and they create a lot of moisture,” said Barker.\n\nView image in fullscreen Cows finding shade beneath a tree on Dartmoor. Scientists are yet to discover why they bunch in heat. Photograph: Paul Mansfield Photography/Getty Images\n\n“Because they don’t use the barn area fully, the areas that they lie in can become wetter and dirtier, which increases their chance of getting mastitis [an udder infection]. They also spend more time standing, which has consequences for their feet, legs and lameness scores.”\n\nSo far, the researchers have learned that bunching in barn-housed dairy herds starts to occur once the hourly ambient temperature rises above about 20C (68F).\n\nThe most productive cows are often worst affected by high temperatures, because milk production is a metabolically intense process that generates body heat. Prolonged heatwaves can reduce their milk yield, with economic consequences for farmers.\n\nOther large mammals also suffer in the heat. “A horse is six to seven times heavier than a human, but only has two times more skin surface, so it has a lower surface area to exchange heat into the environment. This means they can accumulate temperature quite quickly, particularly when exercising,” said Dr Roberta Blake, a veterinary surgeon and animal biomechanics expert at Anglia Ruskin in Writtle, Essex.\n\nAlthough horses can sweat to cool down, this is not always enough. A quirky, yet serious, sign of an excessively hot horse is “thumps” – the equine equivalent of hiccups – thought to be triggered by an electrolyte imbalance. If a horse is exhibiting this or other signs of heatstroke, dousing them in cool water is the best approach.\n\nView image in fullscreen Dousing a horse in cool water can help them avoid heatstroke. Photograph: David Hartley/Shutterstock\n\nWith extreme heat events predicted to become more common as the century progresses, agricultural scientists are increasingly turning their minds to how to mitigate its effects, for example through improved building design.\n\nHelping wild animal populations will be harder, and there could be more mass casualty events as a result, such as swifts falling from the sky, as they did during the May 2022 heatwave, or the deaths of large numbers of fish in oceans, lakes or rivers.\n\nBut there are simple ways to help garden wildlife. Leaving patches of long grass and flowers offers shade and shelter, while a bird bath provides vital water. “Providing food has pros and cons, but we know that animals may find it more difficult to find enough food when it’s really hot, so there might be circumstances where it’s useful, such as providing bird feeders, and so on,” said Thornton.\n\nAs heatwaves intensify, the fate of Britain’s wildlife may depend not just on their instincts, but on our willingness to step in and help.\n\nView image in fullscreen A female blackbird spreading its wings and gular fluttering to keep cool. Photograph: Robert Macdonald/Alamy\n\nSunscreen for cats and other ways to help pets beat the heat\n\nIf you are slathering sunscreen on your own nose and ears, spare a thought for sun-loving pets. The RSPCA is urging cat owners to use pet-safe, waterproof SPF30+ on ear tips, noses and other areas with thin or no fur.\n\nCats, like humans, can develop skin cancer – sometimes requiring surgery. Horses with white markings, and light-skinned or thin-coated dogs are also at risk.\n\nAvoid sunscreens with zinc oxide or salicylates, which are toxic to cats. And while unscented children’s sunscreens may be acceptable alternatives to pet-specific formulations, always check with a vet first.\n\nOther strategies to keep pets safe include providing plenty of water, shade, and time indoors during peak heat (usually 10am to 3pm). A parasol or draped sheet can offer shade in bare gardens.\n\nView image in fullscreen Owners are urged to apply pet-safe sunscreen to their cats. Photograph: Nils Jacobi/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCats can be fussy about water placement. “Owners often put food and water bowls next to each other, because that’s how people eat and drink – but cats like to eat and drink in separate locations,” said Nicky Trevorrow, the senior behaviour manager at Cats Protection. “We think it goes back to African wildcat behaviour, and not wanting to contaminate their water source with the gut contents of their prey.”\n\nMany also prefer to drink with their backs to a wall, and favour wide, shallow bowls to avoid whisker contact, and glass or ceramic bowls over plastic or metal, which can alter the taste.\n\nTo keep pets cool, try placing a frozen water bottle wrapped in a towel near their bed, and use a quiet fan to improve airflow.\n\nPets with dirty rear ends are at risk of flystrike – a painful, sometimes fatal condition where maggots hatch and eat flesh. But even clean pets are not immune. In warm weather, the RSPCA advises twice-daily checks for illness or injury, daily cleaning of toilet areas, and keeping rear ends clean and dry.",

      "title": "We’re becoming inured to Trump’s outbursts – but when he goes quiet, we need to be worried | Jonathan Freedland",
      "text": "In the global attention economy, one titan looms over all others. Donald Trump can command the gaze of the world at a click of those famously short fingers. When he stages a spectacular made-for-TV moment – say, that Oval Office showdown with Volodymyr Zelenskyy – the entire planet sits up and takes notice.\n\nBut that dominance has a curious side-effect. When Trump does something awful and eye-catching, nations tremble and markets move. But when he does something awful but unflashy, it scarcely registers. So long as there’s no jaw-dropping video, no expletive-ridden soundbite, no gimmick or stunt, it can slip by as if it hadn’t happened. Especially now that our senses are dulled through over-stimulation. These days it requires ever more shocking behaviour by the US president to prompt a reaction; we are becoming inured to him. Yet the danger he poses is as sharp as ever.\n\nConsider the events of just the last week or so, few of them stark enough to lead global news bulletins, yet each one another step towards the erosion of democracy in and by the world’s most powerful country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs – yes, he’s climbed back on that dead horse – on Brazil, if the judicial authorities there do not drop the prosecution of the country’s Trump-like former president Jair Bolsonaro, charged with seeking to overturn his 2022 election defeat and leading a coup against the man who beat him, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As concisely as he could manage, Lula explained, via social media, that Brazil is a sovereign country and that an independent judiciary cannot “accept interference or instruction from anyone … No one is above the law.”\n\nThis is becoming a habit of Trump’s. He made the same move in defence of Benjamin Netanyahu last month, hinting that Israel could lose billions in US military aid if the prime minister continues to stand trial on corruption charges. In both cases, Trump was explicit in making the connection between the accused men and himself, decrying as a “witch-hunt” the efforts to hold them to account. “This is nothing more, or less, than an attack on a Political Opponent,” he posted, of Bolsonaro’s legal woes. “Something I know much about!”\n\nIt’s easy to make light of the transparent effort by Trump to forge an international trade union of populist would-be autocrats, but he’s not solely moved by fraternal solidarity. He also wants to dismantle a norm that has long applied across the democratic world, which insists that even those at the top are subject to the law. That norm is an impediment to him, a check on his power. If he can discredit it, so that a new convention arises – one that agrees that leaders can act with impunity – that helps his animating project in the US: the amassing of ever more power to himself and the weakening or elimination of any rival source of authority that might act as a restraint.\n\nHe is being quietly assisted in that goal by those US institutions that should regard themselves as co-equal branches of government – Congress and the supreme court – and whose constitutional duty is to stand up to an overmighty executive. Republicans in Congress have now approved a mega bill that they know will leave future generations of Americans drowning in debt and deprive millions of basic healthcare cover. Even so, they put aside their own judgment and bowed to the man who would be king.\n\nLess discussed was the bill’s extraordinary expansion of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. Its budget has been increased by a reported 308%, with an extra $45bn to spend on detention and $29.9bn for “enforcement and deportation”. It will soon have the capacity to detain nearly 120,000 people at any one time. And, remember, latest figures show that about half of all those detained by Ice have no criminal record at all.\n\nNo wonder even conservative critics are sounding the alarm. The anti-Trump Republicans of the Bulwark warn that within months, the “national brute squad” that is Ice will have twice as many agents as the FBI and its own vast prison system, emerging as “the primary instrument of internal state power”. In this view, Trump has realised that corrupting the FBI is a tall order – though still worth trying – so he is supplanting it with a shadow force shaped in his own image. As the Bulwark puts it: “The American police state is here.”\n\nThose most directly threatened might share clips of masked Ice agents snatching suspected migrants off the streets and manhandling them violently, just as reports circulate of appalling conditions in Ice premises, with people held in “dungeon-like facilities”, more than 100 crammed into a small room, denied showers or a chance to change clothes, and sometimes given only one meal a day and forced to sleep on concrete benches or the floor. But it is hardly a matter of national focus. Because it is not accompanied by a neon-lit Trump performance, it is happening just out of view.\n\nThe same could be said of a series of recent decisions by the supreme court. They may lack the instant, blockbuster impact of past rulings, but they accelerate the same Trump trend away from democracy and towards autocracy.\n\nOn Tuesday, the judges gave Trump the green light to fire federal workers en masse and to dismantle entire government agencies without the approval of Congress. Earlier, the supreme court had ruled that Trump was allowed to remove Democrats from the leadership of government bodies that are meant to be under politically balanced supervision.\n\nMore usefully still for Trump, last month the judges limited the power of the lower courts to block the executive branch, thereby lending a helping hand to one of the president’s most egregious executive orders: his ending of the principle that anyone born in the US is automatically a citizen of the US, a right so fundamental it is enshrined in the constitution. In ruling after ruling, the supreme court is removing restraints on Trump and handing him even more power. Small wonder that when one of the dissenting minority on the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was asked on Thursday what kept her up at night, she answered: “The state of our democracy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is succeeding in his goal of cowing the press, extracting serious cash from major news organisations in return for dropping (usually flimsy) lawsuits against them, a move that is having the desired, chilling effect.\n\nIt all adds up to the steady erosion of US democracy and of democratic norms whose reach once extended far beyond US shores. Even if it is happening quietly, by Trump’s standards, without the familiar sound and fury, it is still happening. The work of opposing it begins with noticing it.",

      "title": "‘Am I minging?’ It’s Big Brother’s greatest moments – 25 years on",
      "text": "Big Brother house, this is the Guardian. You are live to the nation. Please do not swear. Yes, it’s the show that changed the face of British TV. On 18 July, it’s exactly 25 years since the OG reality franchise took our screens by storm – which will be marked this autumn by an extended 25th anniversary series. So we are celebrating by fast-forwarding through a quarter-century of romances, rows and all-round ridiculousness to pick the greatest hits of Big Brother – not the celebrity spin-off, otherwise George Galloway being a cat and “David’s dead!” would definitely feature. Instead we’re talking about the original and best civilian edition, whose pioneering 00s pomp came on Channel 4, before the less loved Channel 5 era – which was axed in 2018 until ITV rebooted it two years ago. These are the Endemol classic’s best bits. How many do you remember? Big Brother will get back to you.\n\nWelcome to the house of fun\n\nBB1, July 2000\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Innocent times’ … Davina McCall with the first Big Brother winner, Craig Phillips. Photograph: Ken McKay/Shutterstock\n\nWe take it for granted now but when the Dutch format arrived on Channel 4, it felt genuinely groundbreaking. Ten punters entered a custom-built, camera-rigged house for the original “social experiment”, with nightly highlight shows and an online live feed (how modern). Davina McCall hosted and over her decade-long stint, became a national treasure. The first intake included lesbian ex-nun Anna Nolan and Darren Ramsay, who chatted to the chickens and named his favourite Marjorie. Innocent times. Well, until …\n\nNasty Nick unmasked\n\nBB1, August 2000\n\nThe show’s breakout moment came when Liverpudlian builder Craig Phillips, the eventual winner, confronted housemate Nick Bateman about cheating. The City broker, who now lives under another name in Australia, had smuggled in pen and paper, then (gasp!) passed notes to manipulate nominations. The nation was outraged as Nasty Nick’s downfall unfolded in real-time. A panto villain was born and it turned reality TV evil for ever.\n\nHelen falls for Paul\n\nBB2, May 2001\n\nThe original BB romance blossomed between Welsh hairdresser Helen Adams (who memorably declared “I like blinking, I do”) and car designer Paul Clarke (who boasted that he “lives like an international pop star”). A world away from today’s shameless Love Island showmances, the endearingly normal couple went on to have a five-year relationship.\n\nBrian Dowling’s demons\n\nBB2, July 2001\n\n“Hold me, Bubble!” Irrepressible Ryanair flight attendant Brian Dowling was hilarious value and voted the all-time most popular winner. Glimpsing cameras behind the mirrors, he would declare them “Demons!”. He busted out a dance routine to Janet Jackson’s Nasty. Halfway through a buzzcut, he turned sideways and had a conversation with his own shaven-headed alter ego. Dowling would become the first out gay children’s TV presenter on SMTV and later hosted BB’s Channel 5 revival.\n\nAlison Hammond’s origin story\n\nBB3, June 2002\n\nView image in fullscreen A star is born … Alison Hammond on Big Brother, 2002. Photograph: ITV\n\nA star was born when Brummie whirlwind Alison climbed on to a garden table to peek over the wall at the outside world. When the table broke, she headed straight to the Diary Room to confess, offering: “I could probably bend it back?” She finished 11th but won the hearts of viewers and is now a much-loved TV fixture.\n\nTim sneakily shaves his chest\n\nBB3, July 2002\n\nLate arrival Tim “nice but dim” Culley won few friends by braying his catchphrase “Comprendez?”. He went down in BB lore by shaving off his ginger chest hair under the duvet, thinking nobody would notice – despite the presence of dozens of cameras.\n\nJade’s verruca\n\nBB3, July 2002\n\nThe late Jade Goody became such a star that she returned for Celebrity Big Brother five years later. Cue a racism controversy which caused an international incident. First time around, though, the dental nurse was endearingly ditsy. Guileless utterances included “Sherlock Holmes invented toilets” and “East Angular – ain’t that abroad?” She didn’t cope well when it was pointed out that she had a verruca, wailing “Am I minging?”\n\nAlex works the camera\n\nBB3, July 2002\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Stared into viewers’ souls’ … Alex Sibley’s lip-syncing in Big Brother 3. Photograph: ITV\n\nHousemates often forget the cameras are there, so it was a spine-tingling moment when finalist Alex Sibley stared straight down the lens and into viewers’ souls. Buttoning his shirt while disco hits played over the tannoy, he lip-synced to KC & the Sunshine Band’s That’s The Way (I Like It), seeming to flirt with the audience at home.\n\nSub-table shenanigans\n\nBB5, July 2004\n\nIt remains a mystery what went on under that tablecloth. BB5 lovebirds Michelle Bass and Stuart Wilson, AKA “Chicken Stu” hid under the kitchen table for some intimate action away from the cameras. When Davina asked for juicy details during her exit interview, Michelle coyly replied “No comment” to squeals from the crowd.\n\nFight Night™\n\nBB5, July 2004\n\n“No naked jacuzzi-ness!” When Emma Greenwood and Michelle Bass were supposedly evicted, they actually moved to a secret bedsit to follow the house action on screens. This spark lit the fuse for the infamous Fight Night. When the pair made their shock return and booze was imbibed, a blazing row erupted between the resident rival cliques, Lip Gloss Bitches vs Jungle Cats. Food was thrown. Tables were flipped. Greenwood and Victor Ebuwa hit each other with trays. Security guards burst in, the live feed was cut and police were called in to investigate. Highlight or new low? You decide.\n\nNádia takes the crown\n\nBB5, August 2004\n\nView image in fullscreen Nádia Almada, winner of Big Brother series five, 2004. Photograph: Bruno Vincent/Getty Images\n\nShowering in high heels. Begging for cigarettes while dressed as a camo-clad soldier. Portugal-born Nádia Almada was the first transgender contestant, making it all the sweeter when she won. She feared a backlash from the public, so when she left the house to a rapturous reception, Nádia was poignantly overwhelmed.\n\nKitten without a cause\n\nBB5, June 2004\n\nRebellious Kitten Pinder’s stint was short but eventful. A Brighton anarchist who lived in a squat, Kitten Pinder was ejected after just eight days for breaking the rules an impressive 30 times. Only the second housemate after Nasty Nick to be booted out, she refused to nominate, tried to move the alcohol fridge into the bedroom and declined to go to the Diary Room when asked. Naturally, when she was thrown out, she refused to leave, resulting in the prize money being reduced. Days later, Kitten was up in court for non-payment of multiple parking fines. She blamed Tony Blair.\n\nMakosi’s phantom hot tub pregnancy\n\nBB6, June 2005\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘I could be pregnant’ … Makosi Musambasi in Big Brother series six, 2005. Photograph: Shutterstock\n\nAfter Makosi Musambasi and eventual winner Anthony Hutton got steamy in the jacuzzi, Makosi stunned everyone by going to the Diary Room and whispering “I could be pregnant.” Within hours, she’d told two housemates that she was “90% sure”, vowing to keep the baby and asking Big Brother for a pregnancy test. Spoiler: she wasn’t pregnant. Anthony denied they’d even had sex.\n\nThe Science bit\n\nBB6, July 2005\n\nLeeds musician Kieron “Science” Harvey became a cult figure for his argumentative nature and sardonic wit. He was forever baiting Conservative speechwriter Derek Laud, memorably during a cardboard box task. His highlight came when housemates Maxwell, Craig and Anthony sat in a row on the sofa. Self-styled “Citizen Science” pointed at his foes one-by-one and spat: “Tweedledum, Tweedledee and TweedleTWAT.”\n\nWine o’clock for Kinga\n\nBB6, July 2005\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘The limits of acceptability’ … Kinga Karokzak’s wine bottle moment in Big Brother 6. Photograph: Shutterstock\n\nIt’s an image seared on viewers’ brains. Outrageous late arrival Kinga Karolczak swiftly made an impression by stripping off for hot tub sessions. One tipsy evening took a surprise turn when she tottered into the garden to become, ahem, better acquainted with a wine bottle. Ofcom later said it “operated at the limits of acceptability”.\n\nNikki’s Diary Room rants\n\nBB7, June 2006\n\nThe late, great Nikki Grahame was the undisputed queen of tantrums and tirades. She complained about the air con (“I’m so cooooold!”) and housemate Richard Newman finishing the cornflakes (“the fat ox!”). Most memorably, she was apoplectic with rage when newcomer Susie Verrico nominated her, despite “not even knowing me”. “Who is she?” shrieked Grahame. “Where did you find her?”\n\nAisleyne says it straight\n\nBB7, June 2006\n\nSelf-confessed “ghetto princess” Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace had a winning way with a put-down. As a late arrival, she soon got the measure of Nikki, telling her: “You better know yourself, little girl.” When she returned in 2015 as a “Time Warp houseguest”, Aisleyne hadn’t lost it. Putting former escort Helen Wood on a bargain budget, she reasoned: “Basic rations for a basic bitch.”\n\nGlyn’s got the eggs factor\n\nBB7, July 2006\n\nIf you know, you know. As gawky Welsh teenager Glynn Wise boiled himself some breakfast, he improvised a catchy little song to celebrate: “I’m cooking an egg for the very first time, ah-mmm.” To this day, BB fans of a certain vintage find themselves humming it when cooking eggs. Fun fact: Glyn is now a priest.\n\nPete takes a dip\n\nBB7, August 2006\n\nView image in fullscreen Pete Bennett in Big Brother series seven, 2006. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nWinner Pete Bennett, a Brighton musician with Tourette syndrome, had an unlikely romance with housemate Nikki Grahame and said in his exit interview that Big Brother had saved his life. All very touching but not as funny as when he lost his balance while chatting in the garden and toppled backwards into the pool.\n\nBrian Belo wets the bed\n\nBB8, July 2007\n\nThe second Brian to win the show, Essex boy Belo provided all manner of inadvertent lolz. He’d never heard of Shakespeare and insisted “the moon is bigger than the universe”. The morning after one of his “cider binges” – this was before duty-of-care protocols were tightened – Brian admitted having “an accident” during the night. Housemates promised they wouldn’t tell anyone, despite it airing on primetime TV.\n\nMario proposes to Lisa\n\nBB9, August 2008\n\nWarrington fortysomethings Mario Marconi and Lisa Appleton were the first contestants to enter the house as a couple – and super Mario had a surprise in store. He donned black tie, stood on a heart-shaped plinth and popped the question via Love Actually-style placards. Loved-up Lisa said yes and they tied the knot two years later. Aww. Except they’ve since split and Lisa has done tell-all interviews admitting that she has struggled with addiction … to sausages. No, really.\n\nJosie Gibbon, more like\n\nBB11, August 2010\n\nLike La Hammond, Josie Gibson is another daytime TV favourite who first found fame on BB. The self-confessed “daft Bristolian bird” won the last edition to be shown on Channel 4 with a record 77.5% of the public vote. However, Gibson’s highlight came when she shared her failsafe mood-lifter: “Whenever I’m feeling a bit low, I think: ‘At least I’m not that woman who had her face ripped off by a chimpanzee’.” Relatable.\n\nAndrew Tate’s early exit\n\nBB17, June 2016\n\nThis lukewarm later series was mainly notable for a certain Andrew Tate being among the housemates. He was ejected on Day Six after a video emerged which apparently showed him hitting a woman with a belt. Tate claimed it was a prank and he’d been misrepresented. In happier news, this run also saw a Diary Room meltdown from ex-model Jayne Connery, who was “bored shitless by conversations about hair tongs” and asked Big Brother: “Are you fucking on drugs?”\n\nCameron comes out\n\nBB19, October 2018\n\nA reminder of reality TV as a force for good. The last series of the Channel 5 era saw 18-year-old Cameron Cole come out as gay during a conversation with housemate Lewis. He eventually plucked up the courage to tell the whole house, prompting fellow contestants to cry, clap and congratulate him. The tender moment led to an outpouring of support on social media. Cameron went on to become BB’s youngest ever winner.\n\nThree’s a crowd\n\nBB20, October 2023\n\nThe defining storyline of ITV’s reboot was a gay love triangle. Lawyer Jordan and food critic Henry quickly clicked – but two weeks later, Jordan began flirting with doctor Matty, despite him having a boyfriend on the outside. Heartbreakingly, Henry broke down in tears because he’d “lost his best friend” in the house. They sweetly patched things up and Jordan went on to win. After dating for 18 months, the pair amicably split.",

      "title": "Supersize me: recreating Pret’s £13 miso salmon super plate at home",
      "text": "This week Pret a Manger sparked uproar when it launched a range of new supersized salads. It came as a response to what Pret said was a “shift in what customers want from lunch”, though possibly not from their wallet, with the premium salads priced £10-£13.\n\nBut how good are they? And is it right that they cost that much? I set off to recreate the miso salmon super plate at home. It’s fun copying the ingredients off the back of a packet to come up with a recipe. With the miso salmon plate, I’m impressed by the original: the plate looks very pretty, and the lightly smoked salmon fillet has an excellent texture. The tenderstem broccoli is just-blanched, and pleasingly crunchy.\n\nIt’s only when I compare the miso-orange dressing with my own version that I realise quite how much sugar must have gone in – ditto the chilli aubergine, which is a bit gloopy (thanks, cornflour). But it’s a generous dish, and with a triple hit of protein from the salmon, soya beans and quinoa, I have none of my usual sugar/chocolate cravings in the afternoon.\n\nBased on the texture of the Pret aubergine, I treated it like the Korean side-dish gaji-namul – steaming the aubergine before stirring through the dressing (minus the cornflour). The homemade dish is very close in taste, but overall my dish tastes punchier, because I used freshly grated ginger and garlic throughout, rather than pastes.\n\nThe significant difference is the cost: Pret’s salad comes in at £12.95, while my homemade one comes in at about £8.14 a person, after factoring in the proportion of each packet or jar used (I got most of it from Sainsbury’s and the more unusual or less widely available ingredients from Sous Chef). But if you haven’t already got shichimi togarashi, gochugaru (red pepper flakes) or aonori seaweed in your cupboard, then you’re setting yourself back £11.65 just on “store-cupboard ingredients” you might never use again. So £8-ish, plus an initial outlay of £12 to recreate this at home, which is more than a bit steep.\n\nThe clincher? I’m not the kind of home cook or food writer who ever, ever wants you to have to use two pans, a steamer, two sieves, three bowls and a baking tray to make a single dish. You might not mind several processes and more than an hour hands-on time for a recipe, but I really do.\n\nUltimately, I’d say the Pret salad is worth £12.95, because there’s no outlay on expensive store-cupboard ingredients and, given its quality (it’s fresher than comparable on the go post-workout meals). And it’d certainly save me £3-£4 on cake/cookies/ice-cream in the afternoon.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Publicity image\n\nHow to make a miso salmon super plate at home\n\nPrep Interminable\n\nCook 20 min\n\nCost £8.14 a portion\n\nServes 2\n\n2 lightly smoked salmon fillets\n\n2 teaspoons mixed seeds\n\n2 teaspoons shichimi togarashi\n\n½ teaspoon aonori seaweed\n\n½ teaspoon sea salt flakes\n\n½ tablespoon rapeseed oil\n\n50g mixed black & white quinoa\n\n½ aubergine, sliced lengthways and cut into 1cm quarter moons\n\n1 clove garlic, peeled and grated\n\n2 tsp gochugaru (red pepper powder)\n\n¼ tsp chilli powder\n\n20ml rapeseed oil\n\n5ml brown rice vinegar\n\n½ tsp sugar\n\n½ tsp sea salt flakes\n\n6 stems tenderstem broccoli\n\n4 heaped tbsp edamame beans\n\n2 handfuls mixed salad leaves\n\n1 ripe avocado, finely sliced and dressed with a little lemon juice\n\n15ml rapeseed oil\n\n15g miso paste (I used red)\n\n10ml brown rice vinegar\n\n½ tsp finely grated ginger\n\n½ tsp finely grated garlic\n\n½ tsp sugar\n\nPinch chilli powder\n\nPinch sea salt flakes\n\n½ lime, cut into quarters to serve\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Feast Free weekly newsletter Recipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

      "title": "Anisimova’s resurgence adds extra layer of mystique to Swiatek final",
      "text": "On a quiet outside clay court at the Hungarian national tennis centre in Budapest nine years ago a pair of outstanding 15-year-olds tussled in front of a few dozen spectators. Although the duel offered glimpses into the potential from both sides of the net, Iga Swiatek defeated Amanda Anisimova 6-4, 6-2 en route to Poland’s triumph over the US in the Junior Fed Cup. Even though Anisimova endured a difficult afternoon, memories of those days immediately drew a smile to her face. “I used to enjoy those Fed Cup trips a lot,” she says. “We had a lot of fun.\n\n“She was playing very well. She was a great junior – I remember a lot of coaches were saying that she’s going to be a big deal one day. They were right.”\n\nMany coaches said similar things about Anisimova in those days and their instincts were also correct. On Saturday Swiatek and Anisimova, now 24 and 23, will meet in the Wimbledon singles final. Despite being born three months apart, this will be their first professional meeting.\n\nFor both of them this has been a long time coming. During their time as juniors, Anisimova immediately flitted ahead of her contemporaries. She was a junior US Open champion in 2017, at the age of 16, and by the time Swiatek won her junior grand slam title at Wimbledon a year later, Anisimova had graduated to the professional tours.\n\nHer first peak was marked by an unforgettable semi-final run at the 2019 French Open and it seemed inevitable that her success would continue. At the same tournament, Swiatek had her own modest breakthrough as she reached the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. Although she was the first from their age group to make it to the highest levels of the sport, Anisimova’s rapid rise soon halted. She struggled with the gruelling nature of being a professional and with grief after her father’s death, taking an eight-month mental health break before returning at the beginning of last year.\n\nHer performances this year have shown the importance of taking a step back and moving at your own pace instead of constantly looking to push through difficulties and pain. With her run this week, she will break into the top 10 from her ranking of 12, rising at least to No 7.\n\nView image in fullscreen Amanda Anisimova is through to her first grand slam final. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock\n\nAnisimova has peerless shot-making abilities – almost nobody on the tour is blessed with her timing, clean technique and hand-eye coordination, which allow her to generate such destructive power from all parts of the court with ease. Yet the biggest revelation on the way to a maiden grand slam final has been the American’s competitive abilities and toughness.\n\nFor much of her career, her talent has been in dialogue with her mental and physical vulnerabilities. After managing the pressure of being the heavy favourite in every match en route to the semi-finals, she was tough in the many moments Sabalenka could have turned the match again.\n\nWhile Anisimova’s path became difficult, Swiatek kept on rising. She is the greatest player of her generation, a five-time grand slam champion. Despite the past 12 months marking one of the most challenging periods she arrived here ranked No 3 in the world.\n\nView image in fullscreen Iga Swiatek won the girls’ title at Wimbledon in 2018. Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nSwiatek’s inability to win a fourth consecutive French Open title, it turns out, has been a blessing in disguise. Instead of catching her breath after yet another French Open title, her relative underperformance on clay allowed her to immediately prepare for the grass-court season. The additional time on the surface has allowed her to gain more comfort than ever before.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In many ways, Anisimova fits the profile of the type of opponent Swiatek can sometimes be vulnerable to on faster surfaces. She is a devastating shotmaker who can take returns early, rob Swiatek of time with her early, flat ball-striking and flatten the Pole’s second serve.\n\nHowever, Swiatek’s tendency to rise up and produce her best on the biggest occasions speaks for itself. She is 5-0 in grand slam finals and 16-2 in big finals, matches that often have not been close.\n\nAlthough Swiatek and Anisimova have taken different paths since those days in Budapest, they have backed up their early promise and established themselves on the biggest stages.\n\nNow they will renew their nine-year rivalry with everything on the line.",

      "title": "Colombia identifies new threat in drug war: the autonomous narco drone sub",
      "text": "The bust was unusual – a narco submarine capable of carrying more than 1.5 tons of cocaine. There were no drugs onboard this time, but most notably, there were no traffickers.\n\nLast week, the Colombian navy announced that it had seized an “autonomous semisubmersible”, the first seizure of such a vessel in the country’s waters.\n\nDetected near Santa Marta, off Colombia’s Caribbean coast, the small grey vessel was equipped with antennas and a Starlink modem. Two surveillance cameras were also installed: one on the bow, providing a real-time view of the craft’s trajectory and obstacles, and another inside to monitor the engine and transmission. Officials believe the uncrewed sub was on a trial run to transport cocaine to the United States or Europe.\n\n“The discovery reflects a migration toward more sophisticated unmanned systems that increase evasion capabilities, and which pose a growing challenge to international maritime security,” said Adm Juan Ricardo Rozo Obregón, commander of the Colombian navy.\n\nThe navy has warned that autonomous technologies are “an emerging threat that is transforming the transnational criminal landscape”, and said that it believed the vessel was operated by the Gulf Clan, Colombia’s largest drug-trafficking group.\n\nThe discovery comes as Colombia – the world’s leading cocaine producer – faces record-high production of the drug, fuelled by surging global demand. The country’s estimated coca leaf cultivation increased from 204,000 to 253,000 hectares (504,000 to 625,000 acres) in 2023, according to the United Nations.\n\nWhile traffickers have used crewed semisubmersibles for decades, the recent advent of the uncrewed vessels shows that gangs are making significant technological advances. They are also seeking new ways to eliminate the risk of captured operators cooperating with authorities.\n\n“It’s definitely a sign of how creative traffickers are becoming, and how ‘narco subs’ have evolved significantly in both design and technology,” said Henry Shuldiner, an investigator at the InSight Crime thinktank, who co-authored a report on the rise of narco subs. “This unmanned model seems like the next step in that evolution.”\n\nShuldiner said that traffickers were testing whether removing crews – which typically involve at least four people, particularly for long transatlantic journeys – could make the lucrative trade more efficient.\n\n“The fact that this appeared to be a test run shows traffickers are willing to invest in research and development, even if that means losing a vessel to authorities,” he said. Building a semisubmersible can cost as little as $150,000, though most estimates place the cost between $1m and $2m.\n\nJuana Cabezas, a researcher at Colombia’s Institute for Development and Peace Studies, told AFP that Mexican drug cartels, which operate in Colombia, began “hiring technology experts and engineers to develop an unmanned submarine” as far back as 2017, adding that drone vessels made it harder for the authorities to identify those behind the shipments.\n\nColombian law punishes the use, construction, possession and transportation of semisubmersibles with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\n\nNonetheless, a near-record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted crossing the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024, according to InSight Crime.\n\n“In some years, we’ve seen 30 or more interdictions globally. And that’s just the ones we know about,” said Shuldiner. “Some US officials estimate that only around 5% of these vessels actually get caught. So even with near-record seizures in 2024, most are still slipping through.”\n\nWhile most cocaine is still smuggled on container ships, narco subs are playing a growing role, especially for long-haul, transoceanic routes, he added.\n\nThe Colombian navy said that in the first half of 2025, 10 semisubmersibles were detected in different regions of the continent, all adapted to make them difficult to track by radar, and even mobilise with partial autonomy.\n\nSergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, said that while this marks the first capture in Colombian waters, it is most likely not the first deployment. “The authorities are one step behind the criminals when it comes to these things,” he said.\n\nHe warned it would be “very difficult” for Colombia and other governments to “keep up” unless countries improve information sharing and cooperation.\n\nGlobally, cocaine production soared by nearly 34% in 2023 compared with the previous year, while an estimated 25 million people used the drug, up from 17 million a decade earlier.",

      "title": "Rayner ’will not be pushed around’ by Unite after union votes to suspend her",
      "text": "Angela Rayner has said she will not be “pushed around” by the Unite trade union after it voted to suspend her membership and rethink its ties with the party.\n\nThe deputy prime minister was censured by the union over her role in the Birmingham bin strike, although party sources said Rayner resigned her membership of Unite some months ago.\n\nThe motion passed at Unite’s policy conference is a sign of how bad relations have become between Labour and its historically largest trade union donor over the dispute about pay and conditions, which the union says would impose pay cuts of £8,000 on some Birmingham workers.\n\nIt is also an escalation of wider tensions between the party and Unite, one of the most leftwing affiliated unions, which has been campaigning against the cuts to the winter fuel allowance cuts and disability benefits.\n\nUnite’s move against Rayner appeared to be largely symbolic and took place as she and her cabinet colleagues were at the prime minister’s official country residence, Chequers, for an away day to look at the political year ahead.\n\nHowever, the threat to cut or further reduce financial ties with Labour could be deeply damaging for the party at a time when it needs to maintain healthy funds to fight off the threats of Reform and the Conservatives.\n\nRayner, who remains a member of Unison, is considered an ally of the unions within Labour and pushed through the party’s package of workers’ rights in the face of opposition from big business.\n\nA party source said: “Angela’s not interested in silly stunts, she’s interested in changing workers’ lives. Unite rejected a deal in Birmingham and their demands would have undermined equal pay, discriminating against female workers. Angela won’t be pushed around, and she quit Unite some months ago.\n\n“Angela’s been fighting for equal pay for decades as a trade unionist, and as a home-care worker has experienced what it was like to be paid less as a working-class woman for the same work.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Striking bin workers stand in front of billboards commissioned by Unite this week in Birmingham. Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty Images\n\nThe Unite motion said Rayner and several Labour councillors had been suspended for “bringing the union into disrepute” and there would be an investigation into their behaviour with a “view to expelling them from the union”, although this would appear not to be possible in Rayner’s case.\n\nShe is understood to have made her last membership payment in April, although she was still recorded as being a member of Unite on the last list of ministerial interests published on 29 May.\n\nThe Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, accused the Labour-led Birmingham council of carrying out action similar to fire-and-rehire as striking workers were being replaced by agency workers and faced the possibility of redundancy.\n\n“Unite is crystal clear it will call out bad employers regardless of the colour of their rosette,” she said. “Angela Rayner has had every opportunity to intervene and resolve this dispute but has instead backed a rogue council that has peddled lies and smeared its workers fighting huge pay cuts.\n\n“The disgraceful actions of the government and a so-called Labour council is essentially fire and rehire and makes a joke of the Employment Relations Act promises. People up and down the country are asking whose side is the Labour government on and coming up with the answer: not workers.”\n\nThe Unite motion, which was passed overwhelmingly, said the union was prepared to discuss its relationship with Labour if Birmingham council forced through the redundancies of striking workers.\n\nIt suggests Unite could be ready to end hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding for the party. Unite gave about £2m to Labour in the year before the election. It has scaled back its financial support in recent years, with Unison now contributing more, but it is historically the party’s biggest union backer, having given more than £70m raised from its members since the Electoral Commission’s records began in 2007.\n\nFriends of Rayner in the union movement rallied round her following the spat, with many dismissing it as a performance to underline Unite’s hardline position in the bin workers’ strike.\n\nOne MP close to the unions said: “Colleagues across the movement are saying Unite have completely lost the plot. Angela has done more for workers than any politician in decades and picking a fight with her shows they’re not serious.\n\n“Frankly, this behaviour won’t deliver for Unite members. It’s seems about [Graham] trying to take the limelight, posturing and her looking to next year’s general secretary election.”\n\nHowever, a senior Unite source said the motion was not a stunt and represented real anger at the conference among delegates about Labour’s position on the bin strike. They said Graham was representing her members and suggested a falling-out with Labour was a growing prospect.\n\nThe union also voted to suspend the membership of John Cotton, the Labour leader of Birmingham council, who on Wednesday said the local authority was at the “absolute limit of what we can offer”. The council has not said what its next steps would be but it said this week that it needed to proceed with changes to its services without delay, as the latest round of talks ended without resolution.\n\nUnite’s dispute is with Birmingham city council, but since 2023 the local authority’s finances and governance have been overseen by government-appointed commissioners who are answerable to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\n\nQuick Guide Contact us about this story Show The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Only Labour is delivering the change working people voted for and so deserve.”\n\nA No 10 spokesperson said of the strike that the government’s priority had always been Birmingham residents.\n\nView image in fullscreen Uncollected refuse bags in the Aston area of Birmingham in June. There are still issues with uncollected rubbish in the city. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nThere is still uncollected rubbish in Birmingham, although the situation has improved since late March when the council declared a major incident over the mountains of bin bags on the streets.\n\nIn May, the council secured a court order preventing striking bin workers on the picket line from delaying bin lorries leaving depots, which was one of their tactics to ensure the strike had the most impact.\n\nMany regular bin collections have since resumed, with the lorries being staffed by agency workers. But parts of the city, particularly more deprived areas, still have piles of waste in the street, with the smell exacerbated by the hot weather.\n\nRecycling bin collections in the city of more than 1 million people have been suspended since early February and residents have been told to take their recycling waste to the tip or store it at home. In reality, many people have put it in their general waste bin, with growing concern about the environmental impact as the strike drags on.",

      "title": "Trump expected to resume weapons deliveries to Ukraine through Nato allies",
      "text": "Donald Trump appears poised to deliver weapons to Ukraine by selling them first to Nato allies in a major policy shift for his administration amid frustrations with Vladimir Putin over stalling negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC News, Trump said he will probably have a “major announcement” on Russia on Monday and confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine.\n\nTrump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is scheduled to arrive in Kyiv on the same day for a week-long trip that comes after the US temporarily halted weapons shipments to Ukraine as part of a Pentagon review of dwindling stockpiles of crucial munitions including Patriot air defense missiles.\n\nThe White House has now sought to distance itself from the decision, and Trump has suggested he is ready to greenlight a major military aid package for Ukraine via Nato, reversing a previous policy of reducing support to the Ukrainian government to force Kyiv to sue for peace.\n\n“I think I’ll have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,” Trump said during the interview with NBC News, which aired on Thursday evening. “I’m disappointed in Russia, but we’ll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”\n\nDuring the interview, Trump laid out a plan by which the US could sell weapons to Nato and then they could be sent on to Ukraine. Trump has not previously approved packages of military aid to Ukraine.\n\n“So what we’re doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons,” Trump said, probably indicating that they would be purchased by countries that are members of the Nato security bloc. Administration officials have said this would be different from the US supplying Ukraine directly, as Nato and not Washington would be making the decision to arm Kyiv.\n\nGermany and other member states of the security bloc had spoken publicly about ongoing negotiations to purchase weapons from the United States to transfer to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is producing more modern weaponry including drones, but still relies on the US to supply everything from Patriot missiles to defend from nightly Russian missile and drone attacks, Himars long-range missiles to strike behind Russian lines, 155mm artillery shells and other munitions.\n\nThe Axios news website said that some officials had said the US would only sell Ukraine “defensive” weapons, while others said the package could also include “offensive” weapons such as the Himars missiles.\n\nYet a key stumbling block remains US military production. The US only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagon’s military plans, the Guardian revealed this month, and fulfilling new orders can take years depending on the priority level given to the contract.\n\nKellogg is expected to address the US weapons shipments during his visit to Kyiv, the first since shortly after Trump’s inauguration.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump also endorsed the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, a bill introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally seen as a leader of Russia hawks in the legislature. Graham has said that the bill would impose “bone-breaking sanctions” on Putin and a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that buy Russian oil and other goods, potentially targeting China and India.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "text": "Liverpool have permanently retired their No 20 shirt in honour of Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash alongside his brother, André Silva, last week. The club have announced that the No 20 will no longer be used across all levels of the club, including the men’s team, the women’s team and through academy levels.\n\nThe tribute, the first in Liverpool’s history, is a reflection of how valued the Portugal international was as a player and a person at the club. Liverpool fans have called for the retirement of the No 20 shirt since the 28-year-old and his brother died in north-western Spain. Liverpool deliberately timed the announcement at 20:20 BST on Friday.\n\nThe decision to retire the shirt was made after consultation with Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and parents, Isabel and Joaquim, who travelled to Merseyside on Friday to witness the outpouring of affection for the striker and the tributes left outside Anfield. Jota’s family were accompanied to the stadium by the entire Liverpool squad as they made their first public appearance since the tragic accident.\n\nJota died just 11 days after his marriage to his long-term partner and left behind three young children. He and his brother were understood to be driving to Santander to take a ferry back to England before pre-season training, having been advised not to fly following a recent lung procedure.\n\nLiverpool will play their first game since the accident at Preston on Sunday, when both clubs will pay a number of tributes to Jota and his brother. Liverpool’s anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone, will be played before kick-off and there will be a minute’s silence at Deepdale, where both sets of players will wear black armbands.",

      "text": "At least 798 people have been killed while seeking food at distribution points operated by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and other humanitarian convoys since the end of May, the UN human rights office said on Friday.\n\nThe GHF, proposed by Israel as an alternative to the UN aid system in Gaza, has been almost universally condemned by rights groups for its violation of principles of humanitarian impartiality and what they have said could be complicity in war crimes.\n\n“Up until 7 July, we’ve recorded now 798 killings, including 615 in the vicinity of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, and 183 presumably on the route of aid convoys,” the UN spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.\n\nIsrael backed the GHF after claiming that Hamas diverted aid from the UN-led aid system, a claim for which the UN said there was no evidence. The private company employs American mercenaries to oversee four food distribution zones, as opposed to the previous 400 non-militarised zones run under the UN system.\n\nThe GHF said the UN figures were “false and misleading” and denied that deadly incidents occurred at its sites. “The fact is the most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to UN convoys,” a GHF spokesperson said.\n\nGHF also denied that any injuries were inflicted at any of its sites, blaming Israeli troops firing on Palestinians trying to reach the four hubs it has established in southern and central Gaza.\n\nIn Gaza, the GHF has become infamous for the near-daily shootings of people seeking food who have queued to receive meals since the group started operating in early May. Palestinians seeking food have to navigate a complicated set of instructions and stick to specific routes, as well as walk long distances to access the food sites. Even then there is no guarantee they will be safe.\n\nOn Friday the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its teams in Gaza were witnessing “a sharp and unprecedented rise in acute malnutrition”. The number of cases at its Gaza City clinic has nearly quadrupled over the past two months.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed and more than 60 injured on Friday when Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd in Rafah, southern Gaza, according to Ahmad al-Farra, the head of paediatrics at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, which received the dead and wounded.\n\nAt least 15 Palestinians were killed overnight and on Friday by Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza, including a strike on a school serving as a refugee shelter.\n\n“The situation in the hospital was like it always is during massacres: extreme overcrowding, shortage of medical supplies and medicines, and a very high number of injured compared with the number of doctors,” said Farra.\n\nTreatment units were set up outside the hospital to cope with the influx of patients as hallways inside filled with the wounded.\n\nThe situation in the hospital, one of the few medical facilities still operating in southern Gaza, was made more difficult after the Israeli military operated in the surrounding areas overnight.\n\nDoctors reported shells landing nearby and heavy gunfire on the outskirts of the hospital, with a number of patients arriving with gunshot wounds.\n\nThe areas around the hospital were filled with encampments for displaced people and witnesses said Israeli forces had stationed tanks and fired teargas at tents. Two local people reported Israeli soldiers in a nearby cemetery, while one said they saw the soldiers exhuming bodies there.\n\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians inspect the destruction at a makeshift displacement camp and adjacent cemetery after a reported incursion by the Israeli military in Khan Younis. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nIsraeli forces withdrew from the surrounding areas in the morning, but Farra warned the hospital only had enough fuel for the next 48 hours unless new supplies arrived. Air conditioning had to be shut off in the hospital to preserve power amid the sweltering summer heat.\n\nNahla abu Qursheen, a 35-year-old mother of four who fled the tanks on Thursday, said those who did return to the encampment found their tents destroyed. Pictures showed ruined tents amid deep furrows in the ground on Friday.\n\n“I still don’t know what happened to our tent. We are still here on the street. Last night was very difficult – missiles and shelling. My children slept on top of each other, just to fit under a single piece of cloth,” Abu Qursheen said, exhausted from sleeping in the street.\n\nIsrael has intensified its airstrikes on Gaza over the last week, as negotiators report a ceasefire deal is in sight, but not yet achieved.\n\nThe US president, Donald Trump, said on Wednesday he was optimistic a deal was possible this week or next, during the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington. Hamas reportedly agreed to release 10 hostages of the 50 that remain, during the two-month ceasefire period.\n\nQatari mediators have warned a ceasefire will take time, as key stumbling blocks remain. Hamas wants assurances that Israel will not restart fighting as it did in mid-March after the first Gaza ceasefire, while Israel is seeking the complete expulsion of Hamas from the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has floated the proposal of relocating the population to a “humanitarian city” in southern Gaza, which legal experts have described as a blueprint for crimes against humanity.\n\nJuliette Touma, the communications director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said such a plan would worsen the humanitarian crisis and forcibly displace people in Gaza.\n\nThe war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 hostages on 7 October 2023. More than 57,000 people have been killed during Israel’s 21 months of military operations there.\n\nAs negotiations drag on, people in Gaza say they are losing hope.\n\n“They say there is a truce, they say! Every day they say it will end today or tomorrow, but it’s all lies. Wake up and stop this war. Enough of the death, the hunger and the constant displacement,” Abu Qursheen said.",

      "text": "HSBC has become the first UK bank to leave the global banking industry’s net zero target-setting group, as campaigners warned it was a “troubling” sign over the lender’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis.\n\nThe move risks triggering further departures from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) by UK banks, in a fresh blow to international climate coordination efforts.\n\nHSBC’s decision follows a wave of exits by big US banks in the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. His return to the White House has spurred a climate backlash as he pushes for higher production of oil and gas.\n\nHSBC was a founding member of the NZBA at its launch in 2021, with the bank’s then chief executive, Noel Quinn, saying it was vital to “establish a robust and transparent framework for monitoring progress” towards net zero carbon-emission targets.\n\n“We want to set that standard for the banking industry. Industry-wide collaboration is essential in achieving that goal,” Quinn said.\n\nConvened by the UN environment programme’s finance initiative but led by banks, the NZBA commits members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 or earlier.\n\nSix of the largest banks in the US – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – left the NZBA after Trump was elected.\n\nUK lenders including Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered and Nationwide were still listed as members as of Friday afternoon.\n\nIn February HSBC announced it was delaying key parts of its climate goals by 20 years and watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.\n\nThe climate campaign group ShareAction condemned the move, saying it was “yet another troubling signal around the bank’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis”.\n\nJeanne Martin, ShareAction’s co-director of corporate engagement, said: “It sends a counterproductive message to governments and companies, despite the multiplying financial risks of global heating and the heatwaves, floods and extreme weather it will bring.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "text": "Police in Northern Ireland are investigating a loyalist bonfire that featured effigies of refugees sitting in a boat as a hate incident.\n\nCrowds in the County Tyrone village of Moygashel cheered on Thursday night when the towering pyre was lit and flames engulfed the vessel and a dozen dark-skinned, lifesize mannequins with lifejackets.\n\nPlacards beneath the boat stated “stop the boats” and “veterans before refugees”. An Ireland flag also burned in the bonfire, which was part of wider loyalist commemorations.\n\nIn a statement hours before the pyre was lit, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was investigating it as a hate incident.\n\nEarlier in the week politicians condemned the stunt as hateful and racist and called for the effigies to be removed or the entire bonfire to be dismantled.\n\nA separate bonfire in Belfast, which is to be lit on Friday night – one of an estimated 300 bonfires across Northern Ireland – has caused controversy because it is on a site that contains asbestos and is close to an electricity substation that powers two hospitals. Northern Ireland’s environment minister, Andrew Muir, urged people not to attend the bonfire out of safety concerns.\n\nImages of the flaming pyre at Moygashel fuelled fresh condemnation of the refugee boat effigies, following anti-immigrant riots in Ballymena last month and renewed political focus in Britain on small boats crossing the Channel.\n\nPatrick Corrigan, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland programme director, said: “It is shameful that the authorities allowed this despicable display of hate to go ahead. What a shocking message to send to local migrant families. It is just weeks since migrant families were forced to flee for their lives when their homes were attacked and set on fire – a chilling pattern of escalating hostility.”\n\nThe Sinn Féin assembly member Colm Gildernew said the effigies were abhorrent and an attempt to dehumanise people. “I welcome that police are treating this as a hate incident. It’s vital those responsible are held accountable for their disgusting actions.”\n\nMike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist party leader and health minister, said the refugee effigies should have been removed. “This image is sickening, deplorable and entirely out of step with what is supposed to be a cultural celebration,” he wrote on X.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their yearly art has itself become a tradition. This year the focus is on the scandal of mass illegal immigration.”\n\nBonfires form part of the annual celebration of the victory of King William III’s Protestant forces over Catholics at the battle of the Boyne in 1690. Parades are to be held across Northern Ireland on Saturday.\n\nA Belfast city council committee voted on Wednesday to send contractors to dismantle the contentious pyre on Meridi Street off Donegall Road, but it is still due to be ignited late on Friday.\n\nPolice refused a request to help, saying letting the bonfire go ahead was less risky than trying to stop it. Paramilitary groups had warned of “widespread disorder” if the pyre was removed, while Sinn Féin said letting the bonfire proceed would be giving in to mob rule.",

      "title": "Former Met police commissioner Ian Blair dies aged 72",
      "text": "Ian Blair, who as commissioner of the Metropolitan police led the force through some of its most tumultuous and troubled times, has died aged 72.\n\nBlair was the first commissioner in more than 100 years to resign from his office and was hailed by the current Met commissioner as “one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades”.\n\nBlair came into post as Met commissioner in February 2005 with a mission and government backing to reform Britain’s largest force.\n\nBut his reign as Britain’s top officer was thrown off course by the worst terrorist attacks ever to hit the country in July 2005.\n\nThe 7 July suicide bomb attacks killed 52 people, and was followed a fortnight later by the shooting dead of an innocent man mistaken by police for a terrorist who had tried to attack London the day before.\n\nThe scandal over the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes was the beginning of the end of Blair’s commissionership.\n\nIn 2008, Boris Johnson, the newly elected mayor of London, ousted him.\n\nThe Met said Blair died on Wednesday, and it is understood he had been ill for some time.\n\nBlair was ennobled in 2010 and spoke out about policing issues in the House of Lords.\n\nThe current Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, said: “Lord Ian’s passing is a huge loss to the police family. He dedicated his life to policing and will be remembered as one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades.\n\n“Lord Ian will also be remembered for the vast contribution he made to improving our overall approach to policing and the service we provide to victims.”\n\nBorn in Chester in 1953, Blair joined the Met in 1974. He was an Oxford graduate, then rare in policing. He eventually moved to Thames Valley police as assistant chief constable before becoming chief constable of Surrey police and returning to the Met in 2000 to take up the position of deputy commissioner.\n\nBlair’s death came 20 years after the month of the two biggest events of his career.\n\nHe faced strong calls for his resignation over the shooting of the innocent Brazilian electrician De Menezes on 22 July 2005, the day after terrorists had attempted a repeat attack on London’s transport system.\n\nComing two weeks after the 7 July London bombings, officers mistook De Menezes for a suicide bomber.\n\nHe was held down and shot repeatedly in the head by an armed officer at Stockwell tube station in south London.\n\nBlair insisted on fighting a health and safety prosecution over the disaster and the force was found guilty by a jury of “catastrophic” failings.\n\nHis labelling as a liberal police officer led to rightwing papers and internal critics damning him as obsessed with political correctness. He stressed the need for neighbourhood policing, but his ideas were being undermined by a force imploding.\n\nSome who were publicly loyal to him were privately aghast at his decisions, his behaviour and his inability to listen.\n\nThe end of his commissionership saw top officers falling out with each other and a senior Asian officer suing for racial discrimination, as the top of the force threatened to collapse into chaos.\n\nHe resigned in 2008. In his resignation letter, Blair said: “It is the duty of the commissioner to lead the Met through good times and bad: to accept the burdens and pressures of office and, above all, to be a steward of the service he commands.”\n\nIn his 2009 memoir, Policing Controversy, Blair warned of the dangers of political meddling in policing: “A police service that serves one political party or individual is an emblem of dictatorship.”",

The decision was taken to “support the author,” according to a statement.\n\nThe Salt Path tells the story of Winn and her husband, Moth, who embark on a 630-mile walk after their house is repossessed and Moth is diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), a terminal illness.\n\nLast weekend, the Observer published an investigation alleging that Winn had lied about being made homeless and about the circumstances under which she and her husband lost their home. It also questioned the legitimacy of Moth’s diagnosis.\n\nOn Wednesday, Winn published a lengthy response denying many of the allegations, and shared medical letters discussing Moth’s CBD.\n\nIn a statement reported by the Bookseller, the publisher said: “Given recent events, in particular intrusive conjecture around Moth’s health condition which has caused considerable distress to Raynor Winn and her family, it is our priority to support the author at this time”.\n\n“With this in mind, Penguin Michael Joseph, together with the author, have made the decision to delay the publication of On Winter Hill from this October.

Winn also withdrew from the planned Saltlines tour, on which she was scheduled to appear alongside the Gigspanner Big Band at a number of UK venues. Refunds have been given to some customers, according to the BBC.\n\nThe Observer accused Winn – whose real name is Sally Walker – of taking “around £64,000” from a former employer, among other allegations. In her response, Winn states: “Any mistakes I made during the years in that office, I deeply regret, and I am truly sorry.”",

      "title": "Sinner dismantles ailing Djokovic to set up Wimbledon final against Alcaraz",
      "text": "When Novak Djokovic strode on to Centre Court for a second contest with Jannik Sinner in little over a month, the narrative had long been set. This was surely one of the 24-time grand slam champion’s last chances for a major victory, a challenge that only continues to grow as age takes him further from his physical peak while Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz move closer to their own.\n\nTwo hours later, by the time Sinner was finished with him, Djokovic’s hopes of winning a 25th grand slam title seemed painfully remote. Sinner completely dismantled an ailing Djokovic, exposing the Serb’s sluggish movement with his weight of shot and unimpeachable defence to reach the Wimbledon final for the first time with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win.\n\nA month after suffering the most devastating loss of his career, holding triple championship point against Alcaraz in the French Open final before losing in five sets, Sinner has offered an admirable presentation of his mental fortitude and resilience by immediately making his way through to another final. Sinner, the world No 1, will have a chance to avenge that defeat at the earliest possible moment as he faces Alcaraz once again after the Spaniard defeated Taylor Fritz in four sets in the other semi-final.\n\nAs their combined grip on men’s tennis continues to strengthen, Alcaraz and Sinner will be the second pair of players in the open era to contest the men’s finals at the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, which Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer achieved for three consecutive years between 2006 and 2008.\n\n“We saw the last final – you never know [what will happen],” Sinner said. “It’s an honour to share the court with Carlos again. We try to push ourselves to the limit. Hopefully it’s going to be a good match like the last one, but I don’t know if it can be better because I don’t think it’s possible.”\n\nThe Italian extends his run of dominance against Djokovic to five wins in a row and he has not lost to him since 2023. He is also the sixth player in the open era to reach four consecutive men’s singles grand slam finals, joining a distinguished list: Federer, Djokovic, Nadal, Andre Agassi and Rod Laver.\n\nBefore the match, Djokovic expressed confidence about his level after their tight three-set match in the French Open semi-finals. At 38 years old, his physical preparedness for a best of five sets battle with Sinner was less certain: Djokovic skipped practice on Thursday after suffering a heavy fall two points before winning his quarter-final against Flavio Cobolli.\n\nSinner immediately made it clear that a long, arduous day awaited Djokovic by performing at a supreme level from the off and, at 1-1, he put together a superb return game to break Djokovic’s serve. The 23-year-old looked impenetrable throughout the first hour, covering every blade of grass with his perfectly timed and balanced open stance, sliding to both sides, which permits him to attack on either ground stroke from any part of the court. He served spectacularly, too, completely shutting Djokovic out of his service games.\n\nBetween his punishing weight of shot off both wings, which constantly stole time from Djokovic, and the difficulty of consistently putting the ball past him, the effect of Sinner’s game on his opponents is total suffocation. Djokovic’s movement was laboured, particularly when forced to change directions in the corners. Midway through set two, Djokovic began to serve and volley practically every other point. But completely ceding the baseline only served to further illustrate his woes.\n\nDown two sets in barely over an hour, Djokovic received a medical timeout for his left leg and inner thigh. Although a brief loss of concentration from Sinner allowed Djokovic to build up a 3-0 lead in set three, with the Serb’s legs increasingly heavy it was only a matter of time before Sinner pulled him back in.\n\nAs Djokovic slowly departed Centre Court, he took his time as he saluted all corners of a stadium that, after witnessing so many of his greatest moments, now sees him in his final stretch. “I just got off the court so, of course, I’m upset and disappointed. Mostly not for the loss, because obviously even if I was fit, I wasn’t a favourite to win against Sinner, I know that, but I think I had good chances if I was fit,” said Djokovic. “But it’s just that physical aspect that is bothering me. You’re there. You want to play. You’re determined. But then the body doesn’t want to listen. That’s it. That’s what you can say about it.”",

      "text": "This week’s masterclass in the renewal of the entente cordiale was based on a genuine desire by two countries to reconnect. But in addition it served as a reminder that diplomacy is not only an art, but art itself has always been an essential tool of diplomacy. So the extended loan of the Bayeux tapestry, exchanged with treasures from Sutton Hoo, is not just a gesture of trust but marks a return to the roots of diplomacy, and its cultural lure.\n\nDoubtless security experts will remember the summit’s declarations of new nuclear co-operation while pollsters will eye “the one in, one out” migrant deal to see if it actually turns the political tide in the Channel. But the popular legacy will be the queues forming at the British Museum from September 2026 when the tapestry goes on display, and in Rouen and Caen when the treasures from Sutton Hoo are viewed by the French in what is already being billed as the “Year of the Normans”. True, some Telegraph readers are already spluttering about the French sending a reminder of their conquest of the Anglo-Saxons, or that Britain is just a convenient place to dump the cloth during the two-year closure of the Bayeux Museum, but the British Museum has the prospect of huge crowds to enjoy.\n\nArt and antiques, alongside silk fabrics, animals and inventions, have always been the mainstay of the diplomatic gift, the entry point and sometimes the centre point for any communication. Indeed in academic literature, art has been described as the mute diplomat. The historian of early modern diplomacy Anthony Colantuono argues that artworks, both as gifts and on display, are not peripheral accessories to political action but are in themselves instruments of diplomatic persuasion or seduction. They function as rhetorical devices, which have the potential to “say that which the [diplomat] is not permitted to say, without uttering a single word”.\n\nSo established had the diplomatic gift become that by 1071 – a little after William I sent his small boats across the Channel – “the Book of Gifts and Rarities” was compiled by an official in the Fatimid caliphate detailing five centuries of lavish presents at Islamic diplomatic meetings, weddings and a circumcision feast. It is a catalogue of artistry capable of filling any national museum. The Doge’s Palace in Venice is in part a monument to the trade in often spiritual gifts designed to bridge cultures between Safavid Persia and Venetian diplomats.\n\nView image in fullscreen A monument to diplomatic trade?

The first known mechanical clock to reach Japan was presented by the Jesuit Francis Xavier in the 1550s to Ōuchi Yoshitaka, the daimyō of Yamaguchi in western Japan. In return for being able to practise religion, the Jesuits offered “a mirror that could make old eyes see afresh” [ie spectacles], an instrument that “could play all the sounds of the thirteen-stringed koto without plucking any strings” (a harpsichord), “two mirrors that made one see far-away things very clearly” (possibly a telescope) and “a sounding bell that did not distinguish between the length of night and day in regulating the hours” (a mechanical clock).\n\nEkaterina Heath, a historian of 19th-century Russia, also points to gifts sometimes not merely being acts of goodwill, but rather a form of “symbolic violence” intended to influence decision-making. The British envoys, she argues, used these gifts to gain leverage and ensure favourable negotiations on issues such as trade and military alliances. The timing of the gifts coincided with efforts to pressure Russia in matters of trade and war, highlighting the strategic nature of these diplomatic gestures. Consequently, during the period 1795–97, the British government sent a range of gifts to Russia: a Herschel telescope for Empress Catherine II, hundreds of exotic plants from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew for Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna, and six horses for Emperor Paul I.\n\nThe most generous ruler would not just send a work of art, but a celebrated artist, as did Philip IV of Spain when he sent Peter Paul Rubens on a diplomatic mission in 1629 to the court of Charles I of England. Rubens completed the preliminary negotiations for a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries, and painted three works for the king.\n\nView image in fullscreen Treasures from the Sutton Hoo burial site will be loaned to France to be exhibited in Normandy.

It arrived reduced to 350 individual pieces and packed in 214 crates, and became a symbol of safe harbour for millions of migrants. Nearly a century later in 1963, the French pulled off a coup after a long debate about loaning national treasures abroad and sent the Mona Lisa overseas for the first time. Her smile, unflustered by the crowds, came to be seen by 1 million Americans at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nBut France has also been the victim of the most infamous disaster in diplomatic gifting of modern times.\n\nIn 2013, a grateful Malian government gave a baby camel to the then French president, François Hollande, during a triumphant visit to Timbuktu after French troops had intervened to weaken Islamist rebels who had seized the north of the country. Hollande left the camel with a local family prior to arranging its transport to Paris, but owing to a miscommunication the family slaughtered the animal and gobbled it up it in a tagine sauce.",

      "title": "‘High aspirations’: the school that embodies Labour’s hopes for special needs",
      "text": "The classroom within All Saints Catholic college, west London, looks much like any other classroom. But this one offers a solution to England’s crisis in special needs education.\n\nOn one recent summer day the class was doing creative writing. Yet with every pupil having special needs in speech and communication, writing is just one part of the lesson. “Remember to reply to me,” the teacher gently reminds one pupil after discussing their work. “When I say something, you need to reply.”\n\nLater a pupil starts “stimming” – self-stimulating by repetitive movements, often seen among children with autism – but is quickly interrupted by the teacher. “Do you need time out?” she asks quietly.\n\nThe classroom, known as the Bethlehem unit, has the rows of desks and whiteboard of a typical school but only eight pupils, who all have education, health and care plans (EHCPs), formal agreements between families and local authorities that detail each child’s needs.\n\nThe fate of EHCPs has been thrust into the political spotlight, after ministers refused to confirm reports that they will be curtailed or abolished. Although its official title is a “specialist resource provision”, the Bethlehem unit is, in effect, a mini special school inside a mainstream secondary – a model that ministers are pinning their hopes on as they prepare a new schools white paper for October.\n\nRia Dhillon, whose son Kai has attended the unit, said the school had been “wonderful”, nudging him to reach his potential in subjects such as maths in which he had previously lacked confidence.\n\n“What we’ve got here, in the Bethleham unit, finds out what they are good at and pushes them. Whereas in a lot of other schools that don’t have these facilities for kids with EHCPs, they seem to get left behind. Quiet children get left at the back,” Dhillon said.\n\nKonstantina Pistola, a teacher in the Bethlehem unit, said: “We want our children to be fully part of the school community. We’re trying to build as much independence as possible so that they are ready for society.”\n\nWith the number of school-age children with EHCPs in England rising to more than 480,000 this year, central and local governments have struggled to keep up, with severe shortages of special school places and long delays causing anger among parents about how their children are being treated.\n\nView image in fullscreen Though All Saints is a mainstream secondary school, about 10% of its pupils have an education, health and care plan. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nThe ballooning number of EHCPs has also created a financial timebomb for councils. Most funding for special educational needs (SEN) provision comes via local authority high-needs budgets but those have been in deficit for years, with the combined shortfall estimated to now be £5bn. The only thing keeping more councils from outright insolvency has been the government allowing them to keep these deficits off their balance sheets.\n\nBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has repeatedly said the government needs to “think differently” about special needs provision. Exactly what Phillipson means is not yet clear. The details are still being thrashed out in Whitehall, with the Treasury taking a close interest in the cost implications, and the Department for Education (DfE) struggling internally to develop coherent policy after years of neglect.\n\nIt seems likely that EHCPs will not survive in their current form, with existing plans phased out over two or more years. Ministers and officials argue that a better solution is for mainstream state schools to educate more children with special needs. That is where All Saints’ Bethlehem unit comes in.\n\nWhile some mainstream state schools have SEN units or specialist provision, what makes All Saints unusual is the high number of its 900 pupils who have EHCPs. The percentage is about 2% for the average school in England.\n\nAndrew O’Neill, All Saints’ headteacher, said: “If we look at this school, about 10% of our children have EHCPs, that’s one of highest rates in the country for a mainstream secondary. It means that this school has to be set up to work for all children of all needs. We have to make sure that they can succeed.”\n\nO’Neill said the “morally right” approach was for every school to enable pupils with special needs and disabilities to access the same teaching, schoolwork and activities as their peers. “It’s about raising attainment and supporting them as well as showing that you have high aspirations for these pupils,” O’Neill said.\n\n“You’ve got to have high standards, the pupils deserve that from the point of view of dignity. High standards should go hand in hand with a joyful experience of school.”\n\nO’Neill has now been appointed as Phillipson’s special adviser on schools on a 12-month secondment that the DfE said will bring “frontline expertise directly into the heart of policymaking”.\n\nPistola explains that the Bethlehem unit can offer specialist provision to children with a wide range of conditions including autism and ADHD.\n\n“We have to tackle each student’s individual needs. For example some students have lots of energy and we have to recognise that, while others want quiet. We are able to be more flexible around student behaviour,” Pistola said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, wants the government to ‘think differently’ about special needs provision. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nWhile some pupils have all their teaching within the unit, those able to study GCSE-level subjects such as sciences or maths are taught in mainstream classes, where All Saints’ innovative structure means they receive help from academic support assistants (ASAs), used in place of traditional teaching assistants to support SEN pupils.\n\nO’Neill said: “Academic support assistants are experts in their subjects, while teaching assistants are typically attached to a single student and follow them through every lesson. The ASAs can offer more technical help for their subjects rather than just for one person.”\n\nChester Smith, a recent graduate who has joined All Saints as an ASA, said he would typically be in a lesson overseeing pupils who need support, checking their understanding, and working with those who were unable to be in the classroom.\n\n“Most often within the class I’m circulating, making sure I talk to the key students I need to talk to first. I’m operating around the room and I can reach more students than a typical teaching assistant,” Smith said.\n\n“There are some kids who can be really challenging but I’ve enjoyed it more than I expected – the work is so stretching and fast-paced.”\n\nCharlotte Healy, whose son Jamal has an EHCP, says she appreciates many of the small things that All Saints is able to do, with teachers on hand at the end of the school day to direct children home through the busy streets of west London, as well as giving regular updates on their progress.\n\n“For parents like us, you’re constantly thinking: are they OK? Are they getting on? Are they making friends, are they with the rest of their peers? That’s a big thing for parents of children with education and health care plans,” said Healy.\n\n“When you do find an environment like this, where it is really good and with the staff to help them grow, you know they care because you get those phone calls and the updates, which are so lovely to hear.”\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Bigger is always better – and nine other sex myths busted",
      "text": "Sex = penetration\n\nAsked to define sex, most people will say it means penetration and anything else is just “foreplay”, explains Kate Moyle, a psychosexual and relationship therapist, and author of The Science of Sex. “This pedestals intercourse as ‘real sex’ and other sexual acts as something done before penetration rather than as deserving credit in their own right,” she says.\n\nLesbian, bisexual and gay people tend to have a broader definition. Sex education historically revolved around reproduction (therefore penetration), which is just one of hundreds of reasons people have sex.\n\nIf you think of penetration as the sex you “should” be having, you might be missing out on the sex you genuinely enjoy. Whether you’re in a penetration rut or tend to have sex the same way, challenge your idea of what intercourse means: “Whenever you have sex, change one small thing – lights on/off, starting with your clothes on/off, a different position, or agreeing not to have penetrative sex,” Moyle suggests. “Novelty can be a real boost for our sex lives.”\n\nIf your partner doesn’t get an erection or get wet, they’re not attracted to you\n\n“Our culture treats the body like a lie detector test,” says Dr Emily Jamea, a sex and relationship therapist and author of Anatomy of Desire: Five Secrets to Create Connection and Cultivate Passion. We’re fed the idea that arousal is instant, automatic and visible, “but bodies are not machines, and things like stress, medications, trauma, hormones or feeling pressured to perform can affect its response”, she adds.\n\nAs psychosexual and relationship therapist James Earl puts it: mind and body don’t always play nice. “Men sometimes get an erection without being turned on, just like women may lubricate without feeling desire. The reverse is also true: you can feel aroused without the physical manifestation,” he explains.\n\nTry not to take the absence of a partner’s erection or wetness as a personal rejection. “It may signal that someone needs a bit more time, safety or stimulation,” Jamea says. “Slow things down, check in and focus on what feels good, not just what ‘should’ be happening in the moment,” she adds.\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian. Makeup by Sarah Cherry using Givenchy Beauty. Model: Alex G at Hired Hands\n\nPorn ruins your sex life\n\nExperts are divided on the impact porn has on our sex lives, and even how addictive it really is. “Some people may watch porn compulsively, but it’s not because porn is addictive,” says Silva Neves, a psychosexual psychotherapist and author. “It’s often because they have other underlying emotional difficulties (most often depression) that they’re trying to soothe.”\n\nBut Alex Warden, a lead therapist at the Priory hospital, Chelmsford, who supports an increasing number of patients being referred to him with pornography addiction, says compulsive viewing can damage a relationship if taken to extremes. “Partners usually feel betrayed and hurt, which can result in a breakdown of communication and intimacy. This tends to be wrapped up in a lot of confusion, shame and a host of mental health issues,” he says.\n\nHowever, Neves points out: “Porn is not a monolith. There are multiple types of porn, some undesirable and misogynistic, and some very good ethical types.”\n\nIf you are an avid viewer, he adds, it’s best to be as open as possible and choose a partner who has similar values around it: “Make sure you watch it in a way that’s pleasurable, matches your own values and allows you to communicate your porn enjoyment with your partner without shame,” he says.\n\nOnly men get sexual performance anxiety\n\nThis can affect everyone, regardless of sex or gender. A review of studies conducted across 18 years found up to 25% of men and 16% of women experience performance anxiety.\n\nThe symptoms are often more obvious if you have a penis: not being able to get or maintain an erection, and premature ejaculation. With vulvas, it may present as reduced lubrication, pelvic floor tightness, reduced pleasure or inhibited orgasm, Moyle explains.\n\nThe anxiety is often rooted in limited, gendered messages we receive about sex. “We feel that if we don’t ‘succeed’, we’ll be judged and shamed; or we believe we’ve failed to meet our partner’s (or our own) expectations,” she says.\n\nIf you have performance anxiety and a regular partner, tell them what’s going on and offer a specific suggestion for what could help. “Where we have communication gaps we fill the spaces with assumptions, which often hold a negative bias, but pretending it isn’t happening is likely to worsen the anxiety,” advises Moyle. If a specific sex act or position is making you anxious, put a pause on it. “It’ll give you a chance to refocus your attention on what is working and feeling good,” she adds.\n\nYou’re naturally either good or bad at sex\n\nJamea says sexual skills are something we all have to learn and work at. “I believe we’re born with the fundamentals that we need to be good lovers, but things happen in our lives – we’re influenced by culture or have a negative experience that disconnects us from those innate qualities.”\n\nGood sex isn’t about a talented performance. “It’s about how good a communicator you are, how safe you make your partner feel and how deeply you’re able to connect with them,” she says.\n\nWhether you think you’re good or bad at sex, having a fixed mindset kills experimentation and prevents growth. Jamea says there’s one question you should ask during sex if you want to be truly great: what feels best for you? “That simple question can turn it into a collaborative experience where you’re co-creators and active participants with the shared goal of making it better for everyone.”\n\nSex stops when you get older\n\nAn Age UK study found 54% of men and 31% of women over 70 are still sexually active. Yet “older people are viewed as sexless by our society, media and the medical community”, says Joan Price, an advocate for “ageless sexuality” and the author of Naked at Our Age: Talking Out Loud About Senior Sex.\n\n“With a spirit of creativity and communication, we can be sexual beings lifelong,” she continues. “Yes, sex changes as we age: we just need to learn to explore new ways of making sexual arousal work for us.”\n\nIf what you used to do isn’t physically possible any more, Price suggests taking turns. “Instead of being frustrated that you can’t find one activity that works for both of you, enjoy double the pleasure by giving and receiving separately.” For partnered and solo senior sex, incorporate vibrators into your sex life. “They speed up arousal and are often the difference between orgasm or not.”\n\nPenis size is important\n\nOnly 55% of straight men and 62% of gay and bisexual men don’t feel anxious about their penis size. “For men especially, there is the belief that the bigger it is the more pleasurable sex will be,” says intimate health expert Dr Shirin Lakhani. Yet the majority of straight women say they don’t care about penis size, and 85% are happy with what their partner is packing. After all, pleasure comes down to much more than the length of a penis.\n\nIf your penis size causes anxiety, share with your sexual partner how you’re feeling. “Even if society has made you feel uncomfortable about discussing penis size, your partner should be understanding and reassuring. There are of course other ways to enjoy sex that don’t focus on penis size,” says Lakhani, who suggests oral sex or using your hands.\n\nPeople only use sex toys if their partner can’t satisfy them\n\nThis myth comes from the belief that sex toys can do things partners can’t, and are therefore “better”.\n\nThink of sex toys as tools, not threats. “They offer something different to partnered sex. The two are not mutually exclusive,” says Moyle. Miranda Christophers, a sex and relationship psychotherapist and clinical director at The Therapy Yard, agrees that they can create different sensations, enhance exploration, add variety and playfulness, boost connection, and help people overcome sexual function issues.\n\nMoyle advises: “If you’re new to sex toys choose a simple vibrator, and trail it all over the body – not just focusing on the parts associated with sex. This can help build anticipation, desire and arousal.”\n\nOnly gay men like anal sex\n\n“Heterosexual men tend to believe that anal sex is a ‘gay thing’,” says Neves. “This myth comes from poor sex education and gay male stereotypes, which can contribute to homophobia.”\n\nAnal sex can be enjoyed by anybody, regardless of sex, gender or sexuality. “Numerous heterosexual men enjoy receiving anal sex. It stimulates the prostate (a gland found between the penis and rectum), which can be very pleasurable,” says Neves.\n\nStill, some men feel shame just for being curious about anal sex, and are less likely to seek information on how to practise it safely. “Start slowly, because the lining of the anus is delicate. Access information on douching, and use plenty of lube,” Neves advises. “You can start by trying a sex toy specifically designed for prostate massage to experiment with how it feels for you. Take it one step at a time.”\n\nYour sex drive is either high or low\n\n“The word ‘drive’ is a misnomer,” Jamea says. “It’s better understood as a motivational system that orients us towards pleasure, connection, novelty or emotional closeness.” Sexual desire is a lot more complex than the drive that comes from hunger or thirst. It also isn’t static and can be shaped by context, stress, hormones, relationship dynamics, how much sleep you’ve had and how emotionally safe you feel with a partner.\n\nJamea suggests trying to think of your sex drive as like a compass that points you towards what helps you feel most alive and connected. “Rather than asking, ‘Am I in the mood right now?’, ask what conditions – individually, relationally or environmentally – could help me feel more open to desire.”",

      "title": "The kindness of Carlos: fans and former coaches hail ‘always humble’ Alcaraz",
      "text": "Is Carlos Alcaraz the kindest man in tennis? His childhood coaches, fans and the 79-year-old widow who collapsed during one of his matches certainly think so.\n\nThe 22-year-old Spaniard, who is riding a 24-match win streak, has spent the last fortnight charming spectators and players alike – and not just with his tennis skills.\n\nThe five-time grand slam champion has won hearts as well as matches at Wimbledon, where he reached the finals for the third consecutive year, after defeating the US player Taylor Fritz in four sets on Friday.\n\nKiko Navarro, Alcaraz’s former coach in his home town of El Palmar, a village in Murcia, is not surprised by the star’s good manners or popularity. “His happiness in his face, which he spreads to the spectators, it was the same when he was a child,” he says.\n\nA young Carlos Alcaraz with his then coach, Kiko Navarro, in his home town of El Palmar, Murcia, Spain. Photograph: Kiko Navarro\n\n“He has always been a humble person. Since he was little, when we would go to play, people would look at us and see that he was the best. And I liked to think that, well, if one day he becomes a tennis player, he would keep that humility, that closeness he has with people – and that is why he has won over all the public.”\n\nAlcaraz’s acts of kindness at Wimbledon have been plentiful and well documented, often neatly translating into bite-size clips that go viral on social media. They include handing over his signed shirt to his Italian opponent Fabio Fognini’s son, Federico, who is a huge fan, and making time to say hello to the four-year-old son of the retired Spanish player Feliciano López, who was at SW19 for the invitation doubles.\n\nAlcaraz also appeared to be the first person to spot 79-year-old Delyth Lewis struggling in the heat in the fifth hour of his five-set epic against Fognini. Alcaraz rushed to the umpire to halt the game before picking up his own water bottles and going to her aid when she fainted. This week the retired bank worker said she was “truly grateful” for his actions: “I’m his number one fan and I hope he lifts the trophy on Sunday.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Alcaraz hands over a water bottle after Delyth Lewis fainted during his first-round match at Wimbledon. Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPA\n\nAlcaraz will face either Novak Djokovic or the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, on Sunday before next month’s US Open, where he will also play mixed doubles with the British No 1, Emma Raducanu, who he has affectionately said is “going to be the boss”.\n\nNavarro said Alcaraz’s good deeds were not for the cameras or sponsorship deals, of which he has many. “It shows that he is a very sensitive person,” he said. “He loves those kind of gestures.\n\n“These are things that come from the heart, which are not things that he does to win over people or brands. He has all his contracts, everything is perfect, but the truth is that he knows how to help people. He has his foundation here in Murcia, Fundación Alcaraz, to help the poorest children, and he loves it, he loves to help people.”\n\nThe consensus was the same among tennis insiders who this week said that what you saw was what you got with Alcaraz, which cannot be said for all players.\n\nView image in fullscreen Alcaraz hugs Fabio Fognini at the end of their first-round match at Wimbledon. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlcaraz often speaks generously of his opponents after defeating them on the courts. On Tuesday he described the former British No 1 Cameron Norrie as “an amazing guy”, adding: “No one works harder than him and it is nice to see him fighting for great things.”\n\nHe also only had warm words to say about the qualifier Oliver Tarvet, who he beat in straight sets, predicting that the British 21-year-old could go on to achieve great things. He later commented on an Instagram post of Tarvet’s, saying: “Great run man, keep going.”\n\nCarlos Santos, who coached Alcaraz from the ages of five to 12, said he had always been polite. “He was always a nice boy. He was magic. He was always smiling. He was a special boy. When Carlos was only 10 years old we travelled around Europe together, and he never caused any problems in the hotel or in matches. He’s different,” he recalled.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that was no different at Wimbledon on Friday morning. “I feel really good,” said a beaming 13-year-old Zoe McCallum, clutching a signed tennis ball Alcaraz had just given her. “He’s just very good at tennis,” she said in answer to why she was a huge fan.\n\nThe schoolgirl and her father, Gavin McCallum, were among hundreds of spectators who had lined up to watch Alcaraz practise on court 16 at 11am before the Spaniard’s semi-final clash against Fritz.\n\nAs well as handing out balls to his youngest admirers at the end of his session, Alcaraz patiently waved and smiled at the hordes who took photos of him and shouted: “Vamos Carlos! We hope you win!”\n\nMcCallum, 50, who had travelled from Glasgow, said: “He’s the new generation. Everybody loved Rafa [Rafael Nadal] but he’s going to be the new Spanish king of tennis. He’s got really good charisma. He’s in the middle of getting ready for the semi-final and he gave my daughter a signed tennis ball. He’s a man of the people. He seems really down to earth; he’s not too up himself and he’s taking time to do stuff with fans which is great. He didn’t have to do it but he’s done it.”\n\nYoung Alcaraz with his childhood coach, Kiko Navarro. Photograph: Kiko Navarro\n\n“He’s just incredibly entertaining,” said 17-year-old Sophie Moore, who was also waiting to catch a glimpse of the man of the moment. “And very good looking,” interrupted her friend Lola Moffatt, 16. “Good looking, young and good at tennis,” she added.\n\nThe students, who hope to have successful tennis careers themselves, said he was the most popular player among their peers. “He’s very personable and humble, compared with other players who are quite immodest,” said Moore.\n\nIt is why Navarro thinks Alcaraz could be one of the kindest players in the sport. “Because in tennis, unfortunately, there are many – I am not going to say names – but they are not very kind to people. It seems that, in the end, in tennis, the public face is also important for brands and sponsors. That’s why Carlos, as well as from his tennis, his way of being gets him such good contracts, with all the best brands in the world.\n\n“But for me what’s important is how Carlitos is, and if Carlitos is kind, that’s enough for me.”",

      "title": "Justin Bieber: Swag review – inane lyrics undermine a gorgeously produced R&B passion project",
      "text": "In the mid-2010s, pop music changed. Instead of hounding the listening public with focus-grouped, machine-tooled crowd-pleasers, the biggest stars began releasing expansive, experimental albums that played to their own tastes and interests. These were records that were artistically self-indulgent, mostly in a good way: Rihanna’s sleazy, sultry Anti, Beyoncé’s densely referential Lemonade, Lady Gaga’s soft-rock-heavy Joanne, Miley Cyrus’s psychedelic Wayne Coyne collaboration Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (I may be the only person who holds that example in such high regard.)\n\nView image in fullscreen The artwork for Swag\n\nWith his fourth album Purpose, Justin Bieber was adjacent to this shift. Leaning into the ascendant tropical house genre, collaborating with Skrillex and pursuing a sound you sensed a 21-year-old might actually like, it spelled the end of Bieber’s career as a cheesy tween idol and repositioned him as a leading figure in the pop zeitgeist. But Purpose still felt like an album designed to spew highly accessible hits. And it did.\n\nA decade on, however – after backsliding into forgettable, generic pop on 2021’s Justice – Bieber has finally made what seems to be a genuine 2015-style passion project. Swag, the 31-year-old’s surprise-released seventh album, opens extremely promisingly with All I Can Take, a hauntological twist on spotless, energetic 1980s R&B: echoey vocals, fast, faded beats, maudlin synths that seem half-remembered from a dream. Abetted by a songwriting and production team that includes Carter Lang (SZA), Tobias Jesso Jr (Dua Lipa, Adele), Eddie Benjamin, Dylan Wiggins and Daniel Chetrit, the sonic vibe echoes throughout the album.\n\nJustin Bieber: Dadz Love ft Lil B – video\n\nIt comes festooned with layered melisma on Butterflies, gated reverb and laser-style synths on the gorgeous Too Long and hyperactive, washed-out drums on First Place. Elsewhere, Bieber’s default sweet and smooth R&B base is counterbalanced by chugging guitar and crashing percussion (the Mk.gee-produced Daisies) and fingers-on-fretboard squeaks of acoustic guitar (the lo-fi Zuma House). Lil B collaboration Dadz Love merges gospelly vocals with a fuzzy breakbeat and blissed-out synths to similarly beautiful effect.\n\nIt’s all very considered, cleverly nostalgic and subtly satisfying – there’s not a craven chart smash in earshot. Lyrically, however, Swag isn’t such a classy and thoughtful affair. Dadz Love is an inane celebration of Bieber’s nascent fatherhood that essentially just repeats the title into meaninglessness. The other love songs – which are addressed to his wife, Hailey, whose viral lip gloss-holding phone case gets a shout-out on Go Baby – rarely transcend superficial, saccharine cliche. But they are at least preferable to the eye-watering spoken-word segments.\n\nDuring a handful of conversations with internet personality Druski, Bieber bemoans the reaction to his discomfitingly intimate social media posts, which have worried fans in recent months (if “people are always asking if I’m OK … it starts to make me feel like I’m the one with issues and everyone else is perfect”). He gets gently ribbed about his altercations with the paparazzi – two examples of which are sampled on this album – and told, sycophantically, that despite his white skin, his musicality is such that he must have a “Black” soul.\n\nThese cringeworthy interludes show a Bieber determined to refute the unflattering caricature of him that prevails in the tabloid sphere. But you would struggle to find much evidence of a three-dimensional human being in his lyrics, which are low on specifics, insight or originality. Despite the album’s seductive, almost spookily evocative sound, the lasting impression is one of eerie emptiness. Swag has moments of brilliance, but this is no long-awaited masterpiece.",

      "title": "The best camping stoves for cooking like a pro in the wild, tested",
      "text": "A reliable camping stove makes all the difference to food alfresco, allowing you to cook a stew in the evening and then warm up in the morning with a hot cup of coffee. The great thing about these stoves is that they’re essentially portable hobs, meaning anything you can cook on the stove at home can be whipped up in the great outdoors by sticking a pot or frying pan on top.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nThere’s a dizzying variety on offer, ranging from dinky ultralight burners that fit into your pocket to big stove-tops with multiple hobs, grills, wind protectors and a lid – the latter are like bringing along your cooker from home. Most run on gas, such as propane and butane, although I’ve also included charcoal options for traditional types. I’ve tested some of the best portable stoves, for everyone from ultralight wild campers to families who need to cook dinners for the masses.\n\nAt a glance\n\nWhy you should trust me\n\nI’m a keen camper and spend many nights a year under canvas, either wild camping solo in the hills or on weekends away in my bell tent with friends and family. Wherever I pitch my tent, I also love making supper in the great outdoors – whether it’s a bowl of noodles in the wild, a hearty stew at a campsite or a spot of marshmallow toasting on a campfire. With my journalist hat on, I’ve been testing all kinds of outdoor kit for years, so I know what works – and what will last.\n\nRead our expert guide to the best tents for more inspiration\n\nHow I tested\n\nView image in fullscreen Each stove was tasked with cooking camping staples. Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\nI fired up each of these nine stoves and cooked camping staples such as porridge, pancakes and fried eggs, as well as checking how long it took to boil water on each. I looked for an easy setup without any complicated instructions to follow and tested to see if each stove cooked evenly and reliably, and that the components felt good quality and built to last.\n\nI hate cleaning stoves, but I took one for the team and gave each of my top-rated models a good scrub to see how easy they were to get spick and span after use. My selection of the best camping stoves includes lightweight numbers and multi-hob monsters, as well as a great mini grill and even a smoker you can take camping.\n\nThe best camping stoves in 2025\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\nBest camping stove overall:\n\nCadac 2 Cook 2 Pro\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\n£99.99 at Robert Dyas\n\n£125 at Decathlon\n\nThis is a compact gas stove with two independent burners. It also has built-in ignition, and ceramic-coated flat and ribbed grill plates, allowing for simultaneous grilling, frying and boiling. It weighs 4.8kg and is compatible with butane and propane.\n\nWhy we love it\n\nThere are camping stoves out there to suit everyone, from the hardiest mountaineer who wants to fit a stove in the palm of their hand to the van-lifers in need of a setup that would rival a kitchen. If pressed, I’d say this was the best camping stove I tested overall.\n\nIt’s lightweight, at less than 5kg, and is portable, folding into its case for carrying and storage. Pop off the lid and there are two burners, each with its own built-in ignition, so you can have coffee going on one and bacon and eggs sizzling on the other. You can also stick two grill surfaces (a ceramic flat plate grill and a ribbed grill plate) on top and simply pop ingredients straight on to sizzle and sear. The case makes for fuss- and mess-free storage in your van or car boot (or cupboard back at home), and it sits sturdily on tabletops.\n\nThis is ideal for campervans or on family camping trips, although it would benefit from the addition of a wind guard, as it doesn’t like anything stronger than a mild breeze. This is also a well-priced camping stove.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t like high winds.\n\nWeight: 4.8kg\n\nBurners: two\n\nFuel type: gas\n\nTime to boil water: six minutes\n\nBest grill:\n\nPrimus Kuchoma portable grill\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\n£154.95 at WildBounds\n\n£163.40 at Cotswold Outdoor\n\nThe Swedish-designed Primus Kuchoma is a lightweight, portable gas-powered grill designed for outdoor cooking adventures. Weighing 4.6kg, it features a ceramic non-stick grill grate, a stainless-steel drip tray and foldable legs.\n\nWhy we love it\n\nThe Kuchoma felt rather like the Cadac 2 Cook 2 Pro in terms of shape, size and portability, but it’s a dedicated grill rather than a two-burner. This was the most portable grill I could find to test, and if you love a proper barbecue but want to travel light, it’ll be your bestie, allowing you to sizzle a steak or brown toast wherever you pitch your tent (or simply on the beach, patio or in the garden).\n\nI liked the foldout legs, which protect the ground and make a solid base for the grill, and there’s room on the Kuchoma to cook supper for two people, with heat distributed well across one wide grill plate. The steel hood seals tight, too, so the burner stays lit in windy weather. It’s quick to remove the grill to wash it and wipe clean the grease tray.\n\nIf you already own a stove, this will be a great addition to liven up your camping culinary adventures more exciting – but it won’t cover the basics such as boiling the kettle or making pasta.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive, especially for a one-trick pony.\n\nWeight: 4.6kg\n\nBurners: one\n\nFuel type: gas\n\nTime to boil water: not applicable\n\nBest for family camping:\n\nCampingaz Camping Kitchen 2 Multi-Cook Plus\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\n£160 at Go Outdoors\n\n£213.99 at Decathlon\n\nThis larger (but still portable) stove has a triple burner, so you can boil, saute and grill all at once. It all sits atop a table and storage shelf with screw-on legs, making for an instant family cooking setup wherever you roam.\n\nWhy we love it\n\nLike to take everything camping but the kitchen sink? Campingaz’s Camping Kitchen 2 Multi-Cook Plus takes the brand’s popular double-burner stove and adds a sturdy table, storage shelf and aluminium griddle with a small burner. This allows you to boil the kettle, stir baked beans and toast bread at the same time – perfect for a proper brekkie. There are also two small-but-useful side tables that are perfect for prep or condiments.\n\nCampingaz uses Flameguard technology to improve fuel efficiency, and I did find it more windproof than some other double-burners, but it didn’t boil water significantly faster in my tests. It’s quick to set up – just screw on the legs if you want to use it as a table, and then pop the lid – and it includes built-in ignition.\n\nIt was my favourite stove for cooking for family and friends, with room for larger pans, and the handy table is a makeshift kitchen even in the most basic camping spot. Another bonus: it’s easy to keep clean, with removable griddle and pan supports.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t have pull-out windguards to help preserve energy, although I can’t find much to critique about this setup.\n\nWeight: 5.4kg\n\nBurners: three\n\nFuel type: gas\n\nTime to boil water: seven minutes\n\nBest for wild campers:\n\nPetromax Atago\n\n£179.95 at Mountain Warehouse\n\n£179.95 at B&Q\n\nThe Atago is a four-in-one charcoal cooking kit designed to function as a grill, stove, oven and firepit. It’s made from stainless steel, which makes it durable, and features a double-walled design for efficient heat retention, plus it has a one-step folding mechanism for portability. It’s also compatible with various iterations of Petromax cast-iron cookware.\n\nWhy we love it\n\nThis might be the hardiest portable stove on the market. The stainless-steel unit uses charcoal or charcoal briquettes for fuel, so it’s ideal for wild campers, foragers and explorers who fancy cooking a feast when they’re far from the nearest plug socket or shop.\n\nThe Atago is designed to be compatible with Petromax’s Dutch ovens, woks, pans and even a camping coffee percolator, although you’ll have to buy these separately – and this cooking system is already expensive. You’ll also have to tend to a fire rather than just turn on the gas, though I found the Atago easy to light and use, plus grilling meat and fish on charcoal gave a wonderful smoky flavour.\n\nGourmet chefs who want to produce Instagram-worthy eats even if they’re in the wild will love this setup, and I liked that it converts into a fire bowl – a great way to have a campfire without causing damage wherever you set up your tent. All in all, this is a fun mini mobile kitchen, and worth investing in if you’re serious about food even when you’re in the backcountry.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive – and you’ll have to buy the accessories.\n\nWeight: 6.1kg\n\nBurners: one\n\nFuel type: charcoal, charcoal briquettes and firewood\n\nTime to boil water: five minutes (once the fire is hot)\n\nBest backpacking/best mini:\n\nMSR Switch\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\n£114.75 at WildBounds\n\n£135 at Valley and Peak\n\n\n\nMSR (Mountain Safety Research) is a US-based outfitter whose tents I rate. In fact, it makes the best tent overall from our recent test. It calls this stove “the ultimate all-in-one cooking system” – and it’s lightweight, compact and efficient. The brand aims the Switch at backpackers and mountaineers who want to boil water fast in the integrated pot, but it also allows you to use other pots and pans.\n\nWhy we love it\n\nThis “personal stove system” is a clever all-in-one option that solo backpackers, bikepackers and wild campers can pop in their rucksack and fire up anywhere. The included pot has a rounded bottom that MSR reckons makes it more efficient at boiling water than a flat design (so much so that there’s a patent pending on it). I found it boiled water very quickly – it was the quickest stove in my test, at three minutes, and made the morning coffee round a pleasure.\n\nThe pot holds 600ml for boiling and has handy markers so you can boil enough water for a cuppa or to fill a ration pack, and it slots easily on to the round potholder above the flame. It’s easy to adjust the stove’s power, too, and there’s a handy cork cosy around the pot for insulation and to make it easier to hold if you’re munching your noodles straight from it.\n\nYou don’t need to use MSR’s integrated pot all the time, either: fold-out pot supports will take larger pans if you’re doing more than boiling water, and there’s a built-in igniter, so there’s no fiddling with old lighters or wet matches. The Switch only really has the capacity to cook for one, though. While it weighs just under 400g, this isn’t the lightest solo system out there – however, I do think it’s one of the best for quality.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s not the lightest system on the market.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Filter Free weekly newsletter Get the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\nMSR XGK EX\n\n£215 at Ellis Brigham\n\nBest for: a multi-fuel stove\n\nMulti-fuel stoves do what they say on the tin, and by allowing you to swap between fuels they’re versatile for travel. MSR’s XGK EX is a popular choice with hardy outdoorsy types as it burns white gas, paraffin and diesel. It’s a hard-wearing stove that should last a long time; its stainless-steel, scorpion-like legs provide a wide, sturdy surface for your pot.\n\nAll this little stove really does is boil liquids (albeit fast and reliably, and it will also melt snow in harsh weather conditions), so you can’t simmer your meal or make anything complicated. It’s pricey, too, so casual campers need not splash their cash here, though for international adventures – where you really need to rely on your kit – it’s worth the spend.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s expensive and has no temperature control.\n\nWeight: 366g\n\nBurners: one\n\nFuel type: gas, paraffin and diesel\n\nTime to boil water: three to five minutes\n\nBar-Be-Quick smoker and grill barbecue\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\n£79.99 at Robert Dyas\n\n£85 at Argos\n\nBest for: a portable barbecue and smoker\n\nA smoker you can take into the sticks? The Bar-Be-Quick’s multilayered design looks too hefty to be portable at first glance – but this smoker and grill (which weighs 8.3kg) will fit into larger cars if you fancy a gourmet camping feast. It can also be converted into a small portable barbecue by taking away the top section, making it ideal for shorter trips. You can then choose whether you fancy smoking, grilling, roasting or steaming ingredients.\n\nDuring testing, it took me a few goes to put the smoker grill together and then to use it correctly, but once I got the hang of it cooking was simple – and more fun than your standard barbecue or camping stove. It works well as a simple charcoal grill, too. This grill perhaps isn’t as solid as some premium models, but it’s good fun and affordable.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s flimsier than some models on test.\n\nWeight: 8.3kg\n\nBurners: one\n\nFuel type: charcoal\n\nTime to boil water: not applicable\n\nPrimus Moja\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: The Guardian\n\n£129.95 at WildBounds\n\n£166.95 at Amazon\n\nBest for: a single burner\n\nMany of the stoves I tested came with a lot of bells, whistles and removable accessories – not so with the Moja, which is pleasingly simple and does one job very well. Open the slim carry case and there’s a single, powerful burner designed for cooking for one to three people. At 2.3kg, the Moja is lightweight enough to be portable for camping and festivals, and it will easily fit into cars (or a backpack at a pinch). It’s also a great size to use as a makeshift cooker in smaller campervans, caravans and boats.\n\nFire up the Moja, and pots sit solidly on top – the lid is removable if you’re using a wider pan. The hob boils water in about five minutes, and the removable drip tray also made this one of the easiest stoves on test to clean.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … its use is limited.\n\nWeight: 2.3kg\n\nBurners: one\n\nFuel type: gas\n\nTime to boil water: five minutes\n\nRobens Fire Beetle\n\n£34.95 at Outdoor Action\n\n£49 at Amazon\n\nBest for: an affordable, lightweight stove\n\nRedefining what it means to be a “Beetles fan”, this compact stove may be small but it’s also mighty. It weighs just 189g – not as featherweight as the teeny, less-than-50g stoves favoured by hardcore hikers, but it’s great for its price and will do just fine for most backpackers and trekkers.\n\nThe Beetle folds out into a surprisingly sturdy pot stand, which I found steady even on uneven surfaces. I’d suggest adding a foil windscreen if you’re out in the wild, as it proved pretty sensitive to any kind of wind, but it was easy to light and control the power of the flame, and it boiled water fast. Other reviewers report this stove doesn’t work well in winter conditions, but in spring it was an efficient cooking companion I barely noticed in my pack – and it’s well priced.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … there are lighter stoves out there if the weight is really important to you.\n\nWeight: 189g\n\nBurners: one\n\nFuel type: gas\n\nTime to boil water: four minutes\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Jacob Little/The Guardian\n\nKey features to look out for\n\nA lightweight canister stove is ideal for boiling water quickly for solo hikers and minimalists, but less suited to multi-pot gourmet meals. For groups or more elaborate campsite cooking, I’d opt for a dual-burner stove so you’ve got room for frying, simmering and brewing coffee all in one place. Ensure you buy the correct fuel canister for your stove.\n\nThe most common models use gas or liquid fuel (paraffin etc), and different canisters are designed to clip or screw on to different stoves. This can be confusing to shop for. Most gas stoves run off propane, butane or a mixture of the two gases. First, check what fuel is recommended for use with your new stove – some are compatible only with branded gas canisters, while others allow multiple fuel options. If you’re camping in cold weather, it’s sensible to pick propane if you can, as it has a lower boiling point.\n\nGas canisters come in different sizes – mini ones are great for wild campers, while big refillable bottles will suit family weekenders. Larger stoves may require a refillable gas bottle – these also usually need you to buy a separate regulator, but they are more eco-friendly, as they can be used again and again. Check if you need a clip-in or screw-in canister and have a go at setting up your new stove with the gas cylinder before you go camping, so you’re confident it works.\n\nWhatever stove you go for, look for features such as wind protection, simmer control and easy ignition (built-in igniters are handy in case you forget to bring matches). Weight, packability and setup time are also important – especially if you’re trekking rather than car camping.\n\nHow to choose a camping stove that will last\n\nIt’s worth investing in the best camping stove you can afford. Stainless steel and titanium offer durability and rust resistance. Canister stoves are perfect for lightweight trips, but make sure you look for sturdy pot supports and quality valves. Liquid fuel stoves often come with serviceable parts, a major plus for longevity.\n\nFuel efficiency is just as important for the planet and your wallet, and a wind-resistant burner will save fuel – and frustration. Wood-burning stoves will appeal to the off-grid minimalist and should last for ever if they’re well constructed.\n\nHow to use a camping stove\n\nFind a stable, flat surface away from tents or dry brush. Wind is your enemy, so shield the stove. Attach the fuel canister or line securely and double-check for leaks before lighting. Most camping stoves require you to turn on the gas and then light with a match or lighter, or click the built-in igniter. Some will burn with a bright blue flame; others are hard to see alight but make a roaring noise. If it’s windy, watch carefully to make sure the flame hasn’t gone out.\n\nWe’ve included wood and charcoal stoves and grills in our roundup – these usually require you to light a fire with kindling and then add bigger pieces of wood until you have a fire hot enough to cook over. Never cook inside your tent: you could poison yourself with carbon monoxide fumes. It’s a sensible idea to have a go at setting up your stove at home first before you head off on holiday – there’s little more frustrating than realising you brought the wrong fuel when you’re desperate for a cuppa.\n\nSian Lewis is an award-winning outdoors and travel journalist and author who loves putting adventure kit through its paces while hiking, swimming and wild camping.

      "title": "Sorry Babbel, but British people say sorry more than nine times a day",
      "text": "British people say “sorry” on average nine times a day, according to research by Babbel, a German language learning app – the upstart Duolingo. Foreigners were baffled that it was so often, and I was baffled that it was so infrequent.\n\nI said it that many times just going once round Tesco Metro (I can’t even process how many times I’d be sorry in the mega-store):\n\nSorry (you are between me and a basket, you ought to have foreseen this, there is only one basket-station. Now that you haven’t, all we can do is mourn); Sorry (I slightly trod on you); Sorry (you’re clearly one of those people who still observes a one-way system, post-Covid, and even though I plainly disagree with this, otherwise I’d also do it, I sympathise with your vexation); Sorry (you’re going way too fast and that’s why we nearly collided, so really you should be sorry, except you seem a bit high, so I am sorry for your predicament); Sorry (we both reached for the same thing, yet the stakes are low, there are 17 more); Sorry (I joined the queue in the wrong place); Sorry (you joined the queue in the wrong place); Sorry (shop assistant, you are very slow to approve my age-sensitive purchase, considering you could ID me from space); Sorry (that my Clubcard isn’t scanning, person behind me, even though I 100% guarantee that yours isn’t going to scan either).\n\nThis is why foreigners don’t understand us; not because of “British understatement” or even our fabulous heuristic of saying the opposite of what we mean, but because the word “sorry” has infinite potential meanings – its intention can change in the middle of saying it. Probably – at a maximum – one time in 10 it means “I did wrong, and I apologise”. Maybe predominantly it means “you did wrong, but no hard feelings”. It can mean, “we’ve both slightly transgressed one another’s boundaries, and this is me signalling that life is too short to thrash out a shared norm, while at the same time, not being ready to completely surrender”. And this is just the sorries in a shop, with absolute strangers, no expectations, no consequences.\n\nA lot of the sorries identified by linguists are actually so strikingly pass-agg, so much like a punch in the face, that I’d never use them unless I was muttering at the radio (as I was, twice in this two-day experiment: “I’m sorry, Conservative former minister, it’s simply not true that you can self-diagnose a mental illness and then get disability benefits”; “Sorry, gentleman on Magic FM, that isn’t how carbon offsetting works”). It’s like conjugating verbs in ancient Flemish: you can use the sarcastic-correction sorry, but only in these very precise circumstances; in private to yourself; as a joke; or on TV.\n\nI stepped out of the house and went for a coffee where, after my first cup, I said a genuine “sorry – can I have another double espresso?” It meant a lot – I would hate to parade my caffeine dependency without shame; I don’t want to put you to a repetitive task five seconds straight after you last did it; yet I do understand commerce, and if I had thought you really minded, I’d have gone with: “I’m really, really sorry.”\n\nAfter that, the gamut of maternal sorries; “sorry you’re too hot” (you are whining, I cannot control the weather); “sorry I didn’t wake you up” (you should have woken yourself up); “sorry there’s no oat milk” (just drink milk). I guess that starts as a jujitsu move, if you apologise enough, they’ll realise that they shouldn’t have complained in the first place? A kind of Basil Fawlty, “the management is processing your complaint, and all he can do is extend his heartfelt contrition, and then have a nervous breakdown”. It doesn’t work, at all. I don’t even know if they know I’m drawing on a deep cultural well of fake apology.\n\nFactor in the sorries of the road – hand-signal sorries; eyebrow-yikes, sorry!; more sarcastic “sorry your indicators seem to be broken” – and by the time you sit down to do any kind of work, the currency has been debased, and if you’ve done anything even mildly wrong, that you actually do all the time, like take two days to reply to something, you’re heading towards “so so so so sorry”; “I want to shoot myself in the face, I’m so sorry”.\n\nIt’s all pretty easy to decode, at least from the inside. The hard thing would be to stop doing it.",

      "title": "Why is Labour so afraid to admit that we must tax the rich? | Andy Beckett",
      "text": "After 125 years of practice, Labour ought to be good at saying why resources should be redistributed from the rich to everyone else. Its founding conference in 1900 passed a motion calling for “a distinct Labour group in Parliament”, to collaborate with any party “promoting legislation in the direct interests” of the working class. Creating a more egalitarian society and politics – which by definition means redistribution from the powerful – was Labour’s original purpose.\n\nBritain was then, and remains, a highly unequal country: more unequal currently than neighbours such as Ireland, the Netherlands and France. This week the children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, said that some British children were living in “almost Dickensian levels of poverty”. But as any expensive but packed restaurant, pavement lined with new Range Rovers or row of smoothly renovated home exteriors will tell you, the rich have been enjoying a long boom in Britain, arguably ever since the Conservatives abolished the top 60% income tax rate 37 years ago.\n\nYet the current Labour government, like others before it, has struggled to devise and promote policies that substantially redistribute wealth. It has proposed or enacted welcome but modest redistributive reforms: removing the tax privileges of non-doms, imposing VAT on private schools, ending the inheritance tax exemption for farmers, removing the winter fuel allowance from wealthier pensioners and reducing the power imbalance between landlords and tenants. But amid the huge controversy these policies have caused – itself a sign of better-off citizens’ sense of entitlement – Labour has either made the argument for greater equality too quietly and tentatively, or not at all.\n\nThis near-silence is surprising in some ways. Populism has familiarised voters again with the idea that elites have too much and the majority too little. Especially in a slow-growing economy, with a government under acute financial strain, politics is often a zero-sum game, where different interests compete for resources. The always revealing British Social Attitudes survey shows that the number of people who believe that “government should redistribute income from the better off to those who are less well off” has risen slowly but steadily over the past 20 years: from under a third to almost half – not an overwhelming proportion, but twice as large as the one that currently supports Labour.\n\nYet instead of the assertiveness with which the privileged and their media allies defend the status quo, the government uses bland, nonconfrontational, supposedly unifying language, such as “country first, party second”, and “working people” – rather than the more politically loaded “working class”. Keir Starmer promises voters more “security”, but without saying that much of today’s insecurity is created by employers, and that situation will have to change. Similarly the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, insists that state spending and ordinary people’s living standards can be improved by better productivity and economic growth, but without saying that this transformation could also be achieved, or deepened, through a different distribution of income and wealth.\n\nIt’s unrealistic to expect centrist politicians to turn into class warriors. But the absence of redistributive arguments from the government’s rhetoric – when it is clearly doing redistributive things – is one of the main reasons this rhetoric seems unconvincing and the government inauthentic. Most voters know Labour is a party that takes from the more privileged to give to those with less – the clue is in the name – so when it pretends otherwise, it can come across as less than honest, and afraid of its enemies. Such evasiveness also means that the ground is not prepared for when redistributive measures, such as tax rises on the rich, can no longer be avoided, because the government needs the money. This autumn’s budget may turn out to be such a moment.\n\nOne explanation for Labour’s awkwardness about redistribution lies in the party’s most maligned period in office, the mid-1970s. Facing a deep financial crisis it had partly inherited from the Conservatives – a depressingly familiar scenario – Harold Wilson’s government imposed a combined income and investment tax rate of 98% on the highest earners. Although tax rates were almost as high under postwar Tory governments, it is Wilson’s that remain infamous.\n\nLess remembered is the fact that, thanks partly to his tax rises, Britons were more financially equal in the mid-1970s than they had ever been before, and ever have been since. Yet Labour seemingly received no electoral benefit: at the next general election, in 1979, it was comfortably defeated by Margaret Thatcher’s anti-egalitarian Conservatives.\n\nWhen Labour returned to office 18 years later, its redistributive policies came heavily disguised. A minimum wage and tax credits for low-paid families were presented as ways to boost the economy and spread the work ethic, rather than also as ways for the wealthy to help the less privileged. Meanwhile, Britain’s economic elites received lavish government praise. “We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich,” said the key New Labour figure Peter Mandelson in 1998, “as long as they pay their taxes.”\n\nThis redistribution by stealth worked well as long as the economy and tax revenues grew healthily, which they did for New Labour’s first 10 years in power. Meanwhile, difficult distributive issues that the party preferred not to think about – the sharply diverging incomes and wealth of Britons, how this polarisation was deepening social divisions, and how these divisions could not be lessened without confronting elites – were largely avoided.\n\nStarmer is governing in much tougher times, just as Gordon Brown did, after New Labour’s economic luck finally ran out in the 2008 financial crisis. Brown’s government raised the top income tax rate from 40% to 50%. The media response was almost universally hostile, but in the weeks afterwards Labour’s position stabilised in the polls, a possible early sign of the 21st century’s pro-redistribution shift.\n\nThis week, speculation that the government will introduce a wealth tax has prompted both strong denials and more ambiguous signals from Downing Street. Some in Labour favour one; others believe that openly egalitarian policies are never wise in what they see as a naturally deferential, hierarchical country.\n\nBut with the government’s shifty approach to redistribution enraging the right without satisfying the left, and leaving less ideological voters believing that the government is just directionless, Labour is in the worst of all worlds. One way out may be to eat the rich, metaphorically speaking, before the rich eat it.",

      "text": "For years, human rights campaigners have been calling for safe routes to the UK for asylum seekers to prevent them from taking dangerous journeys across the Channel in overloaded dinghies, lining the pockets of ruthless people smugglers in the process. So, is Thursday’s announcement of the “one in one out” deal by the UK prime minister and the French president, where one asylum seeker who arrives on a small boat will be sent back to France in exchange for bringing another one to the UK legally, the answer to their prayers?\n\nThe UNHCR and the Refugee Council have cautiously welcomed the announcement, while acknowledging that full details of how the scheme will work in practice are key and not yet available. Others have been less enthusiastic, with the charity Refugee Action condemning the plan for people in life-or-death situations as similar to a nightclub door policy, while Asylum Matters has called it a “Rwanda-style gimmick”.\n\nThe scale of the pilot scheme is modest – it is likely that about 50 people a week who arrive in the UK on small boats will be returned to France, while the same number will be allowed back here. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has refused to be drawn on exact numbers.\n\nWhat will everyone else do? The UK government says it will detain those it plans to return to France, although some may not depart meekly and may legally challenge their removals. Will others who arrive here but are not to be returned have their asylum claims processed? Or will they be left in limbo, and potentially lose contact with the Home Office?\n\nThe scheme sounds fiendishly complex in terms of who will be selected. How will the 50 a week be picked? And how will inadmissibility work? The Home Office has said that some small boat arrivals will have their asylum claims deemed inadmissible and will be packed off back to France. But will other small boat arrivals have their claims deemed admissible and be processed at the same time? I put 10 such questions to the Home Office this morning. It has yet to reply.\n\nFrench politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, have repeatedly blamed the UK’s lax labour laws for the increasing numbers coming to the UK – more than 21,000 so far this year, more than a 50% increase on the same period last year. But that’s not the whole story. According to research from the European parliament cited by BBC Verify in 2022, 11% of the UK’s total economy was “informal economy” – less than France’s 14% and the 17% average for 31 other European countries. If the opportunity to work illegally is the main magnet, why not go to a European country where there are greater opportunities to do this? The reality is that many of the asylum seekers who come here do so to reunite with family, because they speak the language and because they are attracted by the UK’s record of human rights and fair play.\n\nKeir Starmer and Macron make the UK sound like a lucrative El Dorado for those who want to cheat the system by working illegally. The reality is rather different. Those who are working illegally are likely to be paid below the minimum wage in dreadful and exploitative working conditions. And if they are abused, underpaid or not paid at all by their employers, who can they seek redress from? Nobody – because they are not supposed to be here. Those who do work illegally for a pittance are often motivated to do so by debts not yet repaid to smugglers breathing down their necks and threatening their families. And the deterrent of sending an as-yet-unknown number of small boat arrivals back to France is unlikely to be enough to smash the smugglers.\n\nThe motivation and resilience of asylum seekers needs to be factored into this new plan. They are a group of desperate human beings who have already endured persecution in their home countries and difficult journeys across deserts and seas. They will try to do everything possible to survive and thrive. The threat of being sent to Rwanda did not stop the crossings even in the run-up to the first planned flight. They have already made many life-or-death calculations before reaching northern France. I’ve spoken to several asylum seekers this week: they told me that the smugglers are eternally nimble and are likely to be adapting their business model at this moment in response to Thursday’s announcement.\n\nYes, the “one in” part of Thursday’s announcement could be an important first step. But the messy and complex “one out” part is not necessary, and has seemingly only been included to appease the likes of Nigel Farage.\n\nIt is a highly convoluted approach, vulnerable to legal challenges. If the government is serious about solving the small boats problem it should be working with not only safe EU countries but other stable countries across the world to offer safe routes to those fleeing conflict zones, incidentally boosting all our economies by giving people the legal right to work.\n\nProviding safe and legal routes to those fleeing conflict zones would put the people smugglers out of business and be a far more straightforward way of addressing this global problem. Instead, Starmer and co have bottled it, choosing a complicated scheme that may help a few but has as many potential holes in it as a flimsy dinghy trying to cross the Channel.\n\nDiane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil liberties",

      "title": "A bit like AI, Elon Musk seems custom-built to undermine everything good and true in the world | Zoe Williams",
      "text": "Grok, Elon Musk’s X-integrated AI bot, had a Nazi meltdown on Tuesday. It’s useful to recap it fully, not because the content is varied – antisemitic fascism is very one-note – but because its various techniques are so visible. It all started on X, formerly Twitter, when Grok was asked to describe a now-deleted account called @Rad_reflections, which Grok claimed “gleefully celebrated the tragic deaths of white kids in the recent Texas flash floods”, and then “traced” the real name of the account as a Cindy Steinberg, concluding: “classic case of hate dressed as activism – and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.”\n\nThere are things we can say for certain, which is that Grok is antisemitic – an impression, in case we had somehow missed it, the bot was careful to underline with its subsequent assertions that leftist accounts spewing “anti-white hate … often have Ashkenazi Jewish surnames”, and that Hitler would have been the best historical figure to deal with this hate: “he’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively every damn time,” it tweeted (all the posts have since been deleted).\n\nOther things, we can’t be so sure of – was Red_reflections a real account from an authentic leftist, or ersatz leftism from a neo-fascist troll to build data points for “the left is full of hate” thesis, or a figment created by Grok itself? At least one person named Cindy Steinberg does exist, but whether any of them said “I’m glad there are a few less colonizers in the world now and I don’t care whose bootlicking fragile ego that offends” (the putative text of the original tweet about the Texas floods) is contestable.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like a very likely opinion, from anyone. Yet the language is an almost parodic version of the vocabulary of the “wokerati”. It sounds, in other words, completely confected, yet all our shortcuts to calling bullshit have been systematically stripped away. If you say “this sounds made up” before you can prove it’s made up, then your standards are no higher than the people making it up. So the offence just stands there, misattributed, while Nazis make hay with it and everyone else just sighs and hopes for it to die down.\n\nThis routine is so familiar that more searching and playful minds look for a deeper truth: has Grok gone full Hitler-stan by accident or design? Is Grok a large language model, or LLM, at all – or is it Elon Musk himself, the wizard behind the curtain, spewing out a word side-salad to his famous Nazi salute?\n\nMusk’s moves are so clunky, so obvious, inelegant, disconcerting and uncanny, that he’s started himself to resemble an AI-generated image, the human version of a hand with six fingers, not a flesh-and-blood billionaire at all, just a provocative hologram – a trollogram, if you prefer.\n\nAI’s ability to fog and pollute the biosphere of agreed reality and upend any possibility of humane and rational discourse is undisputed. Though we puzzle over whether its synthetic information is accidental or deliberate and then who, if anyone, is pulling the strings – and to what tune. But we balk at admitting what we already know. It doesn’t matter which bits of misinformation are accidental hallucination; distorting reality serves totalitarianism, not democracy. When falsity is introduced on purpose to these systems its agenda is the same..\n\nEverything Musk has done since he bought Twitter (and we’ll only slow ourselves down if we try to trace its origins further back) has destroyed trust – in social media, in democracy, in institutions, in the possibilities of discourse, in observable reality itself.\n\nHannah Arendt made a careful and unarguable account, decades ago, of how important it was to totalitarianism that truth be turned on its head, so that civic life was disoriented and its agents alienated. But even if we imagine her arguments to be inadequate to our modern technological conditions, we have understood 21st-century post-truth pretty well for at least a decade. The techniques of falsity were described in 2015 by Ben Nimmo’s article “Anatomy of an info-war – how Russia’s propaganda machine works”: “dismiss, distort, distract, dismay”. The first three are covered by the “dead cat” approach with which we’re so familiar, but dismay is probably the most interesting: the lifeblood-sucking impact of narratives that are not only untrue but the opposite of the truth, revel in their irrationality, dare you to hold their comments to standards of fairness.\n\nThe sheer ridiculousness of an LLM voicing antisemitism in its crusade against “fascism”, bellowing its own outrage against a message it probably concocted in the first place; the breathtaking hypocrisy of the oligarch Musk, Hitler-saluting while presenting himself as a one-man bastion against a fascist descent – none of this actually disturbs your sense of what is real. What it does, instead, is to destroy your trust in what is permissible. If the world order permits this, then order no longer exists – which is pretty dismaying, but not novelly so.\n\nThe paradox of AI, in its Nazi and non-Nazi forms, is that the concept creates a sense of impotence – your mind can never be as powerful as this omnipotent thing – while the reality creates dependence: “Who shall I ask about what Grok actually said? I know, ChatGPT.” If the situation is dismaying in its particulars, the overall effect is an addictive pessimism – this latest Nazi rant would be a great time to recognise rock bottom.",

      "text": "I was born in the year 1964, which means I am exactly on the cusp between boomer and generation X. This is more than a fascinating fact about me – although it is of course also that. It is a disability. Yet incredibly, at no stage in my entire BBC career did anyone try to make the world accessible for this disability, neither by mandating every single person I might ever work with – or maybe even just humorously touch – to undergo unconscious Greggism training, nor by helping me with off-ramps for my jokes. I was sometimes left literally stranded halfway down a gag about my knob and no one came to my aid. Where was the compassion?\n\nHaving said that, perhaps it still exists in small pockets. I am massively grateful to the close pals whose briefing of the Times resulted in yesterday’s headline: “Gregg Wallace’s autism means he can’t wear underwear, say friends”. I am now keen to encourage further friends to come forward and cite the second medical condition which means that despite knowing that my autism prevents me from wearing underwear, I still have to take my trousers off in front of runners. This is clinical.\n\nEffectively, then, the BBC placed me in the most dangerous possible environment – a series of lucrative jobs in primetime. Would you leave a child in a room full of sharp knives? No. Of course you wouldn’t. Yet apparently it was fine to leave an extremely well-remunerated television presenter in a room full of crew, general dogsbodies and the ones who get your lunch and try not to look at the sock on your cock. Runners, maybe? Listen, I’m an authentic greengrocer. I don’t see rank.\n\nIronically, my dismissal letter from BBC head of compliance, Claire Powell (what’s the betting – middle-aged?), accidentally admits the scale of the corporation’s evil and inhumanity. In the course of banning me from working at the BBC, Claire writes – and I quote – “I have also taken into account whether your behaviour could be improved with training and/or coaching. I do not have the confidence that you can change what seems to be learned behaviour for you to make what you perceive to be jokes in the working environment, without understanding the boundaries of what is appropriate.” Well, there it is in black and white. I can’t be improved – I have an untreatable condition. The BBC is sacking someone for having an untreatable condition. That, my friends, is against every law of this once great land. See you in court, sweet cheeks.\n\nAs I said in my Instagram post, fine, maybe I am guilty of using inappropriate language for the strictly limited time period between 2005 and 2018. Yet I am now being caricatured as unpleasant or exhausting to work with. By who? Some silly cows. The end. It’s the numbers I find absurd. Think of how many people I’ve worked with over the years – or, let’s face it – how many people have been junior to me over the years. And only 13 of them alleged inappropriate behaviour. And then another 50 once the investigation was announced. This is a rounding error.\n\nAsk any one of my four wives and they’d tell you that I am someone you have to look after, all the time. As either my second or third wife maybe used to say to me: “Gregg, you literally can’t do anything for yourself.” And I thought yes: you are exactly right. You have understood my struggle. Although, ultimately, it didn’t work out because she wasn’t up to dealing with my needs. Anyway, I’ve got another one now.\n\nI freely admit I am my own second worst enemy. My first worst is Kirsty Wark. But what this means is that the BBC failed to protect me from both my first and second worst enemies. Again: this is literally illegal.\n\nSo what now? What now for Gregg Wallace the brand – and indeed for Gregg Wallace the man? The answer is clear. It is time, you will be relieved to hear, for me to pivot. And in a momentous decision for both me and the byways of England, I have decided to do what so many boomers in books and movies have done before me. I have decided to set out on a walk. Why? Because I was made televisually homeless through no fault of my own. Because I have an untreatable condition.\n\nThus my path will be a journey both physical and mental. But rest assured, as anyone who has ever been lucky enough to be served a dish by me will know, it will not be oversalted. Instead it will be a journey into the Britain I know is out there. The real Britain. Not the Britain of the mardy makeup girl – while you’re down there, face-ache! – nor the Britain of the Claires and the Kirstys and all the other ones, which is as constricting as a pair of underpants worn in a public setting. But the authentic Britain, all those wonderful people who, purely because I was in it, made MasterChef roughly the 17th most popular programme on television.\n\nAnd with that, I’m heading for the open road. Perhaps you might meet me out there, striding shirtless (and perhaps pantsless) down a bridleway, both of us able to appreciate those simple, natural pleasures – the wind on your face, the hand on your arse. And the message of my journey will be one of hope – hope for all those out there looking for a sign that personal growth is just for chicks and runners. I will not simply go quietly. I am Gregg Wallace. I exist. Get over it.",

      "title": "Digested week: Reeves’s tears and standing room only for Macron’s Westminster speech",
      "text": "Monday\n\nIn all of the coverage given to Rachel Reeves’s tears during last week’s prime minister’s questions, one thing got rather overlooked. Crying in the House of Commons is not particularly unusual. It just becomes news when it’s the chancellor who is the one doing the crying. Even the financial markets take an interest: weird how a woman having a normal feeling can cause turmoil, but no one bats an eyelid at male sociopaths.\n\nOnly a day earlier, the new Labour backbencher Marie Tidball, who is disabled, was on the verge of tears while she was speaking against her own party’s welfare bill. No one batted an eyebrow. The former Tory MP Charles Walker was twice in tears in the chamber. The first in 2015 when David Cameron and William Hague tried to strongarm him into trying to remove John Bercow as speaker; the second in 2022 during a vote on fracking in the 49-day tenure of Liz Truss as prime minister.\n\nAnd those are just the ones I can remember sketching. Then there is the crying that goes on out of sight and off camera. MPs frequently talk of being reduced to tears as whips and colleagues try to bully and threaten them into voting with their party in the lobbies. Most MPs try to pass this off as part of the job. “Politicians need to have a thick skin,” they say. Possibly, though, you have to wonder at the hypocrisy.\n\nWe are told that the reason Reeves cried was a personal matter. Though having an exceptionally bad week in one of the most stressful jobs imaginable and then hearing your boss refuse to back you during PMQs might make any of us cry.\n\nAnd the last thing you’d want to do afterwards is to be pushed into a press conference the next day to try to show you’re OK. But that was what Rachel and the Labour party felt they had to do. It looked like an act of cruelty.\n\nTuesday\n\nIt seems The Salt Path may not be all it was cracked up to be. The book and film claimed to be the true story of Raynor Winn and her husband, Moth, but an investigation by the Observer has uncovered alleged discrepancies in Winn’s account. First, Raynor and Moth – aka Sally and Tim Walker – didn’t lose their house as the result of a naive business investment. The Observer claims that Sally had embezzled tens of thousands of pounds from the estate agency where she worked as an accountant. Instead of being taken to court, Sally and Tim borrowed money from a friend to cover the amount she had stolen. When she couldn’t repay the loan she had taken out, her house was repossessed, the Observer says.\n\nThen there is the question of Moth/Tim’s health. Raynor writes that he had been diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration, a neurological condition that can cause increasingly severe physical and cognitive disability that invariably ends in death in about eight years. Moth/Tim is still alive 18 years after diagnosis, something Raynor puts down to the effects of their 630-mile walk along the South West Coast Path. The Observer has found nine specialists who consider this to be an impossibility. Sally/Raynor still insists that her account is the true one, has published medical letters on her husband’s condition and is taking legal advice.\n\nThis is a book that went on to sell 2m copies and became a film with an A-list cast. If the allegations are true, it’s strange how none of this came out before.\n\nWednesday\n\nEmmanuel Macron may not have been granted the top venue for his address to both houses of parliament – Westminster Hall has been the stage for VVIPs like the Queen, the Pope, Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama – but it was still standing room only in the Royal Gallery. Which is more than can be said for some visiting heads of states.\n\nI’ve been to several similar speeches where there have been plenty of empty seats towards the back shortly before the event was due to start as peers and MPs decide they can’t be bothered to turn up. Cue panic among the doorkeepers as they rush to save the visitor’s blushes by rounding up as many members of Westminster staff as they can to fill up the spaces.\n\nLater that evening the French president attended a state banquet at Windsor Castle where he was introduced to the king, who was covered in medals from head to foot. All of them either awarded by his mother or himself. God knows what Macron and his wife, Brigitte, made of it. Perhaps you get used to this kind of thing when you’re a world leader.\n\nMacron’s visit also prompted talk of the next world leader to get the full state treatment. Donald Trump. The rumour factory is in overdrive. One is that the government is trying to get round the problem of Agent Orange giving an address to parliament by inviting him over when the Commons is in recess. So sorry, Donald. We would have loved to hear you. But we’re closed.\n\nView image in fullscreen Macron with a few medals and Charles with many at the Windsor Castle banquet. Photograph: Aaron Chown/Reuters\n\nThursday\n\nOne by one, some of those Tory MPs who either stood down in the face of the inevitable or lost their seats at the last election have joined the ranks of Reform. Next to join Team Nigel Farage has been Jake Berry, who was party chairman during Liz Truss’s brief time in No 10. I could have sworn I heard Berry on the radio a few weeks ago slagging off Reform. Given that Nige has already promised something in the region of £80bn worth of tax cuts with his pledge to raise the income tax threshold to £20K, a man who was at the centre of crashing the economy in 2022 looks to be an ideal fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nView image in fullscreen Starmer: ‘What happens to the migrants we send back to you?’ Macron: ‘They try again.’ Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\nFriday\n\nIt’s coming up to the anniversary of one of my more spectacular – and embarrassing – brain fades. On a Saturday in July last year, I was just having breakfast when the phone rang. It was Vicky Dawson, the organiser of the book festival at the Buxton International Festival. “Where are you?” she said. “Er … I’m at home,” I replied. There was a pause. “That’s not ideal,” she continued. “You’re supposed to be speaking at the Opera House in 10 minutes. We’ve got 600 people waiting to hear you.”\n\n“But that’s not until next Saturday,” I said. “It’s in the diary.” “Then I think you’ll find you put it in on the wrong day,” she observed.\n\nIf it had been me left with explaining to a theatre why the speaker had not shown up, I would have been shouting and screaming at me. I guess this is why she is running a major festival and I’m not. Instead, she couldn’t have been nicer. These things happen, she said, understanding it had been a genuine mistake. “Could you come back next year?”\n\nSo on Wednesday 23 July I will be at Buxton Opera House. I expect to have some well-deserved piss-taking from Vicky and the audience for only being a year late.",

      "title": "A rightwing minister told Sweden to get tough on crime – until his own son was caught in a Nazi scandal | Martin Gelin",
      "text": "Before the elections next year, Sweden’s conservative government has been eager to avoid accusations of racism or xenophobia. So it’s unfortunate that it keeps being plagued by scandals involving both.\n\nThe Swedish investigative magazine Expo revealed earlier this month that a minister in the governing coalition, whom it did not name, had a close family member active in violent far-right and neo-Nazi groups. The family member had, Expo claimed, participated in activities with a far-right network classified as a terrorist group by the US.\n\nFor almost two weeks the minister’s name swirled around social media, but all the major news outlets in Sweden refused to publish it, claiming they were protecting the identity of a minor who had not chosen a life in the public eye.\n\nThis week the migration minister, Johan Forssell, was finally outed after being called to a hearing in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament, to answer questions about the scandal – and his teenage son. Eventually he showed up for an interview with Sweden’s national news channel, TV4, in which he said he was “shocked and horrified” by the discovery.\n\nThe revelation that the scandal involved Forssell is particularly remarkable, since he has built a reputation on claims that parental responsibility is the only real way to prevent crime. He has also suggested parents should be held legally accountable for the crimes of their children.\n\nWhile Forssell’s son is not suspected of any crime, he is alleged to have attended in-person meetings with at least two neo-Nazi groups. In one picture published by the magazine, he appears to make a Nazi salute. In an internal chat, the son wrote: “We must get rid of the imported violence” and “it’s time for Europeans to fight back!”, according to Expo.\n\nAwkwardly for Forssell, an MP for the Moderate party led by the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, he has generally advocated for the most radical shift towards punitive policies in Swedish criminal justice in decades, including harsher punishment for minors.\n\nAnd in social media posts, Forssell has claimed that the leftwing opposition is in denial about the role of “parental responsibility as a method for crime prevention”. The best way to prevent criminality, he has insisted, is “attentive parents who give their children love and set clear boundaries”. Now the minister wants us to accept that he was clueless that his own child was reportedly active online in neo-Nazi groups, let alone implicated in a violent extremist group with international ties.\n\nDespite the potential risks for Sweden’s national security, Forssell’s party colleagues repeatedly downplayed the scandal. The justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, simply ignored a question about it, saying he didn’t have an opinion on the issue. A leading Stockholm conservative in the Moderate party, Iréne Svenonius, claimed that the real scandal was that news media reported it at all; it was a “new low”, she said. Another former Moderate party MP made light of the story, saying, falsely, that this was just a teenager “posting some memes”.\n\nEbba Busch, the deputy prime minister, said it was a “sign of strength” for Forssell to “voluntarily make this information public”. But this was the opposite of what actually happened: Forssell and his party colleagues had frantically tried to hide the story, hoping he would be able to remain anonymous.\n\nA local newspaper, Västerbottens-Kuriren, published Forssell’s name in an editorial, but officials in the Moderate party called not just the publisher but also the individual writer to complain. Such explicit intervention is highly controversial in a country where the government is supposed to respect the independence of the press.\n\nDespite Forssell’s long public record of blaming parents for the sins of their children, he took no direct responsibility when finally confronted in the TV interview. Instead, he seemed keen to shift the blame from parents to online platforms, asking: “What is social media doing to our children?” While his own social media accounts have countless negative posts about migrants, the minister casts himself as a passive victim of circumstances. “Sometimes, things go wrong,” he shrugged.\n\nForssell says he has no intention of resigning. But the timing of this scandal is inconvenient to say the least for Sweden’s conservatives, whose governing coalition is backed by the far-right Sweden Democrats.\n\nFor many years, as they pursued harsh immigration policies and tough-sounding rhetoric, xenophobic statements bounced off nationalist politicians in terms of political support. But rightwing parties are now falling significantly behind in national polls. As a voting bloc they are almost 10 points behind the centre-left opposition and they have lost most of their support among young voters.\n\nThe governing parties and their allies seem to realise that accusations of xenophobia can be an electoral liability. In June, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, which have roots in neo-Nazism, released an internal report about their past, and party leaders apologised to Swedish Jews. This was a transparent effort to convey a more tolerant, mainstream image before the election, when they hope to become a formal part of government. Jimmie Åkesson, the party leader, has said he will only prop up a governing coalition if he can be prime minister.\n\nHis attempt to clean up the party’s image is already in trouble, however. When Mahmoud Khalfi, the chair of the Islamic Association, suggested the Sweden Democrats should also apologise to the country’s Muslim population, an influential voice in the Sweden Democrats, the MP Richard Jomshof, launched a vicious attack on Khalfi and Islam, which he called a “hateful ideology”. Khalfi should be “thrown out of Sweden, head first”, Jomshof said.\n\nA government that claims to take concerns over crime, safety and national security seriously while ignoring far-right extremism will struggle with credibility. Sweden has a long tradition of refusing to face up to its racism – past and present. But racism could still decide the next election.\n\nMartin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter",

      "title": "The doctors’ strike threatens to scupper the NHS’s recovery – this time, the BMA has overreached",
      "text": "Good news and bad news for the NHS this week. Waiting lists are falling a bit faster: May’s figures, out yesterday, show the lowest waiting list total in two years, as well as the highest number of treatments ever recorded. But yes, lists are still long, at 7.36 million, with 40% of people waiting longer than 18 weeks.\n\nMore good news today: patients are more satisfied, or less dissatisfied, with GPs: 70% satisfied with contacting the GP and 75% reported a good overall experience. The extra 1,900 GPs and the increased rollout of phone and NHS app bookings are reducing the 8am fastest-finger scramble.\n\nThe bad news is England’s resident (junior) doctors’ 90% vote to strike. The British Medical Association’s rush to strike action, with only two weeks’ notice, is hard on patients with rapid cancellations and managers preparing for the five-day chaos, with doctors out from 25 to 30 July. If any voted just to strengthen their union’s negotiating position, they find themselves called out fast. Why did 45% fail to vote at all, when turnout last time was 71%? Picket lines may be thinner but the NHS, in slow recovery, will be thrown backwards again: with 11 separate walkouts between 2022 and 2024, 1.3m healthcare appointments were lost, costing £1.5bn.\n\nThe BMA may find only a grudging solidarity from some unions. Immediately after the election, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, settled with resident doctors, giving a 22.3% rise over two years, and an above-inflation 5.4% this year: that’s an average increase in pay of 28.9% over three years, meaning starting salaries will be up £9,500. Other NHS staff in England – nurses, midwives and physiotherapists – are offered 3.6%. It’s impossible to imagine Streeting conceding the doctors’ new 29% claim – which, the BMA says, is needed to reverse cuts to the real-terms value of their pay since 2008. But that sum is disputed, as the BMA uses the retail prices index (RPI) to measure inflation since 2008. The consumer price index (CPI), used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since 2013, puts their real loss at 4.7%.\n\nEveryone wants to get back to 2008, before the bankers crash; that’s true of teachers, too, whose pay has fallen behind, like the entire public sector. But this is a poorer, Brexit- stricken country, with growth practically stagnant, battered like the rest by world events. Public and private sector pay has fallen over the past few years, despite a slight uptick recently. People feel it in their shopping. If wages grew at pre-crash rates, public pay would be 56% higher, with the private sector 40% better off. I know it’s an absurd measurement, but the prime minister’s salary is 57% lower than had it kept pace with inflation since 2009.\n\nIn this pay climate, the doctors may lack sympathy. Their last pay rise came out of general NHS funds, paid in part by abolishing NHS England. Dipping into the service again for a 29% claim looks unlikely. Even if more taxes were raised, the NHS already takes 40% of departmental spending.\n\nThe BMA’s language is out of kilter with the times, as it calls the offer “derisory” and “insulting”, with its co-chair saying people are “excited to go again” with strikes. Last time, over half the public backed the doctors strikes: a May YouGov poll finds 48% opposed to further strike action, with 39% of voters in favour.\n\nI hear there is much complaint about the strike among doctors, but expect very few to dare speak out in public. Clare Gerada, former president of the Royal College of GPs, is one. But her polite objections draw poison on social media. Incidentally, she tells me the high cost of the strike last time was money spent on paying overtime to other doctors, with “consultants … getting above £3,000 to fill in for a weekend”. Consultants are also balloting over pay.\n\nEngland’s 77,000 resident doctors have good reasons to protest – but less over pay than their careers. Their training is gruelling compared with any other students. Due to abysmal stop-go planning by previous health secretaries, 20,000 of them are stuck in a bottleneck, with five applying for every training post, up from 2:1 five years ago. Streeting says he wants to talk to the BMA about conditions: he has just ordered UK-trained doctors to take precedence for these posts over their foreign-trained peers, and created almost 2,000 more GP posts by changing practices’ hiring finances.\n\nMeanwhile, Streeting’s 10-year plan has been greeted with enthusiasm for its principles – prevention, neighbourhood and electronic records – if doubts about delivery. Those of us of who have been following the NHS for decades haven’t enough fingers to count the “long-term plans” and “plans big enough to see from space” that cause acronym storms of administrative upheaval, before another one comes along. But this gets a fair wind for its local clinics starting in poorest places, and public support in polling.\n\nPopular demand has brought back Nye, the National Theatre’s play about the founding of the NHS. By chance I saw it on Wednesday, the day after the strike was announced. Herbert Morrison, a sceptic, warns Nye Bevan (Michael Sheen) that “no health minister has ever persuaded the British Medical Association to agree anything”, greeted by knowing gales of laughter from the audience.\n\nBevan replies: “Exactly. So we have to break the union.” Morrison is astounded at this from a leftist. “They’re middle class, that’s fine,” says Bevan, to even more laughter from an audience that seemed NHS-heavy, and they weren’t laughing in support of doctors. True, battles between NHS staff and politicians rarely end well for health secretaries, but this time the BMA may have overreached.\n\nThe play ends with a list of facts loudly applauded: “Within 10 years of the NHS being launched, infant mortality fell by 50%.” Support for the NHS is as strong as ever, but anxiety about the state of it will only worsen if its improvement is blocked by strikes.",

      "title": "The Guardian view on Starmer and Macron’s channel crossings deal: safe routes hold the key to future progress | Editorial",
      "text": "To use a football analogy that he might appreciate, the first year of Sir Keir Starmer’s premiership has been a game of two halves. Domestically, grievous strategic mistakes have been made. On the foreign stage, however, an approach that Sir Keir likes to style as “quiet, serious diplomacy” has yielded some tangible results.\n\nFor the most part, this week’s state visit by Emmanuel Macron further showcased the benefits of leaving behind the blowhard politics of the post-Brexit years. Sir Keir and the French president used the occasion to pledge greater cooperation on security and strengthened their joint commitment to safeguarding Ukraine’s future as a sovereign independent state. But the biggest take-away from Mr Macron’s trip launched the prime minister straight back into toxic domestic terrain.\n\nThe announcement of a “one in, one out” migrant returns deal with France represents the government’s most high-profile attempt to halt the Channel crossings, which led last year to a record 86 deaths at sea. In the spirit of a renewed “entente amicale”, Mr Macron has agreed to the automatic return of a small proportion of migrants reaching Britain on small boats. In exchange, the UK will offer safe routes from France for an equivalent number of asylum seekers. The prime minister hopes this agreement can work sufficiently well to be scaled up, acting as a deterrent to those currently willing to risk their lives to reach our shores.\n\nThe stakes, both ethically and politically, cannot be overstated. Sir Keir is absolutely right to suggest that Labour must combat the performative outrage of Nigel Farage and Reform – to which he has at times lamentably pandered – with a more humane, “social democratic” response to the Channel crossings. As the Guardian’s reporting has this week underlined, the desperate situation of refugees on the French coast shames political authorities on both sides of the Channel. But whether this week’s deal constitutes such a response is much less clear.\n\nMost obviously, it is difficult to see how a pilot scheme targeting only a very small proportion of arrivals can ever offer “proof of concept” of deterrence. Many migrants using irregular routes, having already risked so much, will surely choose to take their chances as before. The selection procedure for those to be sent back to France is also murky, and returns decisions will almost certainly be subject to legal challenge. Implementation of the plan will ultimately depend on the verdict of the European Commission as to its legality. Italy, Spain and Greece have already made their objections known.\n\nDelay and confusion would only lead to more gruesome headlines for Labour. In one respect though, Sir Keir was justified in describing the scheme as “groundbreaking”. For years, Conservative governments have attempted to stop Channel crossings through devising unjust and unworkable deterrence measures such as the Rwanda scheme. The only result has been a rising toll of human misery.\n\nBy agreeing for the first time to expand safe routes to Britain for asylum seekers – albeit on a tiny scale – the prime minister offered a glimpse of a different, more compassionate solution. Going further, in cooperation with countries of origin and European partners, would be the most effective way to undermine the business models of people-smugglers, especially if combined with meaningful levels of aid to the world’s poorest countries. Labour should be focusing more on how it lets refugees in, and less on how it can find new ways to kick them out.",

      "text": "“All autobiographies are lies,” George Bernard Shaw wrote in 1898. “I do not mean unconscious, unintentional lies: I mean deliberate lies.” The veracity of autobiographical writing is under scrutiny once again following allegations that the bestselling memoir The Salt Path is not quite the “unflinchingly honest” account of one couple’s triumph over adversity as billed.\n\nEven if you are not one of the two million people to have bought the book, and haven’t seen the film released this summer, you will doubtless know the story of a couple’s 630-mile journey along the South Coast Way after facing homelessness and a diagnosis of terminal illness. Published in 2018, The Salt Path struck a chord during lockdown as readers discovered the solace of walking and nature during the pandemic. But this tale of wild-camping and the kindness of strangers, not to mention the seemingly miraculous healing powers of a long hike, has gone from word-of-mouth sensation to publishing scandal due to the charges of omission (including past theft) and possible commission levelled by the Observer at its author Raynor Winn (real name Sally Walker). Winn has described the article as “grotesquely unfair [and] highly misleading”.\n\nMemoir can be a deceptively explosive genre. “I feel duped. But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers,” Oprah Winfrey told James Frey publicly, after his addiction memoir A Million Little Pieces, which her book club propelled on to the bestseller lists, was exposed as wildly overblown in 2006. Readers feel similarly betrayed by Winn – perhaps more so. Frey, who has just published a novel after 20 years, made no bones about his unreliability as a narrator and former addict. Following in the muddy footsteps of memoirs such as Helen Macdonald’s H is for Hawk, Amy Liptrot’s The Outrun and Raising Hare by Chloe Dalton (shortlisted for this year’s Women’s prize for non-fiction), The Salt Path was part of the gentler trend of redemptive nature writing that blossomed after the misery memoir had been wrung dry.\n\nThe line between fact and fiction is inevitably blurred. No one is surprised that memoirists omit or embellish details, or that novelists draw on their own lives. Writers must navigate this conundrum. Julie Myerson was widely criticised for writing about her son’s addiction in her 2009 memoir The Lost Child. In 2022 she addressed the same issues in a novel titled Nonfiction. “This book is completely made up. It is also completely true,” she said in a Guardian interview.\n\nAutofiction exists in this grey area. The genre, which claims the Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux, garners acclaim but rarely huge sales. If The Salt Path had been marketed as autofiction the outcry might have been avoided. But its success rested on the belief that it was a true story.\n\nThough genre-blurring is part of an evolving literary culture, categories are not just about where titles go in bookshops. Readers need to know what is fact or fiction. Many readers who took comfort from The Salt Path would not be seduced by online wellness influencers or miracle cures. In a post-truth era, the credibility of publishing is crucial. The Penguin logo is a symbol of trust.\n\nAs Oscar Wilde said “the truth is rarely pure and never simple”. Readers understand this. But it is the duty of memoir writers to tell their truth, however murky or complicated it may be.",

Our reviewer wrote that it feels “like one of Ninja’s most well-thought-out appliances” with “every cooking setting you could possibly need”. We’ve only seen it drop to this price once before, in the lead-up to Christmas, so now’s a good chance to snap up the offer.\n\nNinja crispi 3.8l portable air fryer: Was £179.99, now £119.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nSave £60 on the Ninja crispi air fryer, one of the brand's latest releases. This space-saving appliance delivers full-size air fryer power in a compact, portable design that is ideal for smaller kitchens, student living or weekends away. Our senior tech critic, Alex Lee, put it to the test earlier in the year and was seriously impressed, calling the glass cooking container a \"game changer\" for letting you watch your food crisp to perfection.\n\nNinja creami: Was £199.99, now £149.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Ninja )\n\nIf the July heat has you craving cool and refreshing desserts, you're in luck. Ninja’s creami has 25 per cent in the Prime Day sale. Designed to whip up homemade smoothies, ice creams, sorbets and more, the appliance proved “pretty fool-proof\" when we put it to the test, and it comes complete with three tubs for making batches and storing them in the freezer with ease.\n\nNinja perfect temperature kettle: Was £99.99, now £67.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( ninja-kettle-Indybest )\n\nOur best temperature control kettle for hi-tech design now has more than 30 per cent off in the Prime Day sale. While it’s not the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this kettle, it’s still a decent saving of £32. There are six temperature buttons for all your standard hot drinks, as well as more precise settings that allow you to set the temperature between increments from 40C to 100C. Our reviewer praised its “swanky design” and, after a little practice with its various settings, found it “incredibly easy to use”.\n\nNinja zerostick stainless steel 30cm frying pan: Was £59.99, now £39.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nNinja zerostick stainless steel 30cm frying pan ( Ninja / Amazon )\n\nA great Amazon Prime Day deal is one offering a top product – that you needed anyway – at a reasonable price. If you’re currently losing a significant portion of your dinner to a weathered “non-stick” pan, this Ninja deal ticks all three boxes. It sits atop our roundup of the best non-stick frying pans, and benefits from a chunky 33 per cent Prime Day discount.\n\nNinja staysharp 6-piece knife set: Was £179.99, now £119.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nShopping for the best kitchen knife sets? Ninja’s staysharp knife block took the title of the best set with a sharpener, with it getting high praise from our tester. As well as five kitchen knives, this set also comes with a pair of scissors.\n\nThe integrated sharpener “means you’ll always have super-sharp knives with little effort”, according to our reviewer. Ninja says they should last you at least 10 years if you sharpen them regularly. I’ve had the set for just over two years, and with regular sharpening, they work just as well as the day she started using them.\n\nNinja blast portable blender: Was £49.99, now £38, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis compact blender is perfect if you're tight on kitchen storage space. Plus, thanks to USB charging, you can take it to the gym for your post-workout protein shake. Our tester’s banana and berries smoothie “came out perfectly” and they even managed to whip up some pancake batter in it. With a 24 per cent discount for Prime Day, it’s only a few pounds off its cheapest ever price.\n\nNinja slushi frozen drinks maker: Was £349.99, now £307, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Ninja )\n\nThis 12 per cent discount doesn’t look huge, but it will save you £42.99 on one of Ninja’s most coveted appliances. In his test, IndyBest deputy editor Alex found it made some of the best drinks he’s ever tested, turning out perfect slushies, frappes, and frozen cocktails. One of his few criticisms was the high price, so any saving could be worth snapping up for a delicious way to beat the heatwave.\n\nNinja woodfire electric outdoor oven: Was £349.99, now £279.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Ninja )\n\nGet ready to impress your garden party guests this summer, with 20 per cent off Ninja’s woodfire electric outdoor oven for Prime Day. There are preset settings for different pizzas, including 'artisan', which our reviewer said had a “lovely charred taste and crispy crust”. You can also opt for a “moist and chewy” New York style or even a calzone.\n\nNinja two-in-one detect power blender pro: Was £135.88, now £104.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nNinja two-in-one detect power blender pro ( Ninja / Amazon )\n\nNinja blenders always perform well on test – the Ninja foodi power blender three-in-one (was £169.99, now £149, Amazon.co.uk) tops our list of the best blenders. This model has both brains and brawn, automatically detecting the ingredients and portion size of your soon-to-be liquid then adjusting its speed, time and pulse accordingly to deliver the desired results. A look at its Amazon history tells us that the detect power blender pro’s lowest ever price was £101.40, so this is a solid deal.\n\nNinja foodi max pro health grill: Was £299.99, now £169.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nNinja’s foodi max pro grill can grill everything from steaks to veggie kebabs, plus you can use it to air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate and more. When our reviewer tested the original foodi max grill, which has slightly fewer functions, they were “bowled over by its ease of use, speedy cooking and fantastic results”.\n\nAmazon has slashed the price of the grill by 43 per cent, so now’s a good time to nab a discount.\n\nNinja foodi 9-in-1 possible pan: Was £129.99, now £74.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you don’t have the space to stack multiple saucepans and frying pans, the Ninja possible pan could be the solution. The brand claims that you can steam, simmer, roast, braise, bake, saute, sear, boil and fry with its multipurpose pan, saving you precious kitchen space.\n\nIndyBest reviewer, Lois Borny, pitted the possible pan against its coveted non-stick rival, the Our Place always pan. Her favourite was Ninja's version, with its durability winning her over. “Given that the Ninja possible pan can handle metal utensils and high heat, it seems to be more equipped to deal with the bumps, scrapes and conditions that come with everyday cooking,” she said. It’s not the cheapest that it’s ever been, but with 42 per off, you’ll still get a decent discount.\n\nNinja foodi three-in-one toaster grill and panini press: Was £149.99, now £109.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Ninja )\n\nA three-figure fee for a toaster may raise some eyebrows, but this clever contraption validates its price tag. Not only does it occupy the number one spot in our guide to the best toasters, but it also serves the function of a grill and panini press. “If you love sourdough or other toasting bread, you’ll love how easily long slices fit into this toaster,” our tester Rachael writes. “It has seven settings, to ensure you get your preferred crispness, while the grill function is ideal for open-faced sandwiches and quick snacks.”\n\nWhy you can trust IndyBest to find the best Ninja deals in the Amazon Prime Day sale\n\nAs The Independent’s consumer editor, I’ve covered sales events – Amazon Prime Day included – for years. Many of Ninja’s appliances have been reviewed by the IndyBest team and me, and it’s these approved models that I look out for when picking the best deals for you, to help guarantee you not only save money but also end up with a Ninja appliance you’ll love.\n\nHow to shop Ninja Prime Day deals\n\nIt’s worth remembering that Prime Day is for Amazon Prime subscribers only.

Consider this your ultimate guide to navigating the sale.\n\nI’ve handpicked everything I consider worthwhile. Personal highlights include mega savings on Ninja appliances and popular beauty products. But there are also savings to be had on Amazon’s own devices – think Kindles, Echo Dot smart speakers and Fire tablets.

Case in point: this Foreo face massager is reduced by more than £150. Beauty expert Helen Wilson-Beevers scored the device highly in her guide to the best face massagers. She said the three treatment settings have been created for “toning, firming or contouring skin and, handily, they’re only about two minutes long”. She also described the massage sensation as “suitably energising”.\n\nSimba firm hybrid pillow: Was £159, now £127, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Simba )\n\nAlthough our tester loved this pillow, Simba’s hybrid design is very expensive. However, this Amazon Prime Day deal brings you 20 per cent off. If you like a firm pillow, “you will struggle to find a more comfortable option than this one”, our reviewer said. They explained: “You can remove or add more fibre layers to find the right loft and softness for you.” Best of all, one side of the pillow is covered in cooling fabric that draws heat away from your head – perfect for this heatwave.\n\nDuux whisper flex smart standing fan: Was £169.99, now £122.50, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Duux )\n\nWhen IndyBest’s reviewers put the best fans to the test, this model was praised for its quiet operation. It offers 26 speed settings and adjustable height, so you can use it as a desktop fan as well as a floor fan. “In night mode, the LED temperature display dims, and it can be set to run for between 1-12 hours before switching off automatically,” our tester said. Now, it comes with a discount of almost 30 per cent for Prime Day.\n\nOral-B iO2: Was £100, now £39.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( The Independent )\n\nThe Oral-B iO2 is the most affordable electric toothbrush in the iO range, delivering top cleaning power for less. Usually on sale for around £50, Prime Day sees it drop to just £40. It strips back all the bells and whistles of pricier models in the iO range “while keeping the all-important, premium, oscillating brush head technology”, writes tech critic Steve Hogarty. There are also plenty of essential features to help with brushing, including a pressure sensor and a 30-second timer.\n\nSony WH-1000XM5: Was £379, now £219, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIndyBest senior tech writer Alex Lee has loved the Sony WH-1000XM5 for years – in his tests he found that “you won’t hear a better-sounding pair of headphones”. They topped our list of the best headphones until earlier this year, when they were replaced with the newer XM6 (£399, Amazon.com). That means these classics now have a huge 42 per cent discount, making them the cheapest we’ve ever seen them.\n\nColor Wow extra strength dream coat: Was £32, now £18.24, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThe Color Wow dream coat is a staple in my summer haircare routine. Whether I’m curling my hair or using my Dyson airwrap, it tames frizz and keeps the style in place. Beauty reviewer, Ellis Cochrane, agrees: “If you struggle with frizz or find that your hair immediately reacts at the slightest bit of humidity, this is the one Color Wow product you need to try”. I’ve never seen the hairspray drop to this price on Amazon, so now’s a good time to save on it.\n\nTonies Disney ultimate starter set bundle: £149.99, now £111.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nWe're big fans of the Toniebox here at IndyBest, having rated it as the best toy for 4-year-olds when trying to limit screen time. Tester Sarah Dawson said “if you’re looking to buy an extra-special present which will be used on repeat, the Toniebox is the one.” We rarely see big discounts on Tonieboxes, and were pleased to see this Disney bundle with 25 per cent off. It comes with Disney favourites – Sleeping Beauty, Ariel, Cinderella, Jasmine and Tinkerbell (which usually retail for £15 each).\n\nRing battery video doorbell: Was £99.99, now £49.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nTired of missing parcels? I’ve spotted the Ring video doorbell reduced by half price in the Prime Day sale. This is the biggest discount on Amazon that I’ve seen for this model, so now’s a good time to add it to your basket. When our reviewer tested the video doorbell pro, which has slightly more advanced features like low-light sight, they found it easy to install, explaining that it took \"just a few minutes to set up”. However, they did stress that if you want your video footage kept on cloud storage, you’ll have to pay a monthly subscription cost.\n\nAmazon Fire TV stick 4K: Was £59.99, now £27.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you want to upgrade the smart features on your TV, check out this deal on the Amazon Fire TV stick. Reduced to £27.99, which is only a few pounds off its cheapest ever price, this dongle and remote control give you access to entertainment from Amazon’s own Prime Video streaming service as well as Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, as well as live TV and music.\n\nMaybelline sky high lash sensational mascara: Was £12.99, now £5.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you’re yet to try Maybelline’s viral sky high mascara, now’s a good chance with this deal that sees it reduced by 54 per cent. When IndyBest editor, Sarah Jones, put the mascara to the test, she found that her “eyelashes instantly looked lengthened and lifted, and most impressively, stayed that way all day”. It isn’t the lowest price this mascara has been, but it’s still a decent saving on an already budget-friendly product.\n\nBraun smart IPL skin i-expert: Was £899, now £399.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( braun )\n\nIt's still a little pricey, but this highly rated IPL hair-removal device is now better than half price at Amazon. In her guide to the best IPL machines, Beauty expert Lucy Partington found that it's “great for using on the underarms”. She added that the device was “quick and convenient to use”, with a full-body session taking her just 15–20 minutes.\n\nThe Botanist Islay dry gin, 700ml: Was £37, now £28, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( The Botanist )\n\nIf your drinks cabinet needs restocking ahead of summer parties and garden gatherings, here’s a deal on one of our favourite tipples. Taking the top spot in drinks expert Aidy Smith’s guide to the best gins, this bottle boasts a blend of 31 botanicals. Aidy's tests found that, “from classics like coriander seed and lemon peel to local gems such as apple mint, creeping thistle, and mugwort leaves, this gin is a wonderful celebration of Islay’s unique flora”. A discount of almost 25 per cent makes this tipple even more tempting.\n\nGhd original hair styler: Was £139, now £88.19, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Maisie Bovingdon )\n\nFashion and beauty writer Maisie Bovingdon’s favourite hair straighteners are reduced this Prime Day. Maisie loved the fact that the ghd styler is super quick to heat up and easy to use. “The ceramic plates provide constant and even heat to effectively style your hair in one glide,” she said. With almost 40 per cent off the hair tool’s price at Amazon, sleek strands just became more affordable.\n\nApple AirPods Pro 2: Was £229, now £179, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Apple )\n\nWhen it comes to wireless earbuds, it’s hard to beat the AirPods Pro 2 for noise cancellation. In his review, The Independent’s technology critic David Phelan found the headphones were “good enough to reduce continuous sounds such as engine noise on a train”. Plus, he highlighted clever features, such as personalised spatial audio, which uses the camera on your iPhone to adjust the audio according to how your ear looks. Right now, there’s £50 off at Amazon, which is the lowest price they’ve ever been. The last time they were this cheap was during Black Friday.\n\nWhoop 5.0 with Whoop one 12-month subscription: Was £169, now £152, Amazon.co.uk\n\nThe 5.0 offers new features like Healthspan for longevity testing and an AI health coach ( Emilie Lavinia/The Independent )\n\n“The Whoop 5.0 is the best health coach you’ll find outside of a human being, and it’s incredibly smart in the way it uses biometric data,” wrote fitness and wellbeing editor Emilie Lavinia in her review of the Whoop 5.0. “During my testing period, my sleep, VO2 max, and daily step count improved, and I got a better sense of how my body was responding to stress and exercise,” she added. If, like me, you’re tempted, it’s currently reduced to its lowest-ever price for Prime Day.\n\n( Apple )\n\nConstantly losing your keys? If you also own an iPhone, this deal on Apple’s AirTag could be just what you need. The tracking device comes in the form of a badge-sized stainless steel disc, and it will help you locate lost items via ultra-wideband technology. Even if your item is out of range, other nearby Apple devices will begin pinging the AirTag, so you can get constant updates on its location. “This is one huge advantage over its competitors, considering the sheer number of Apple devices in the world,” said IndyBest tech critic Alex Lee in his review. Right now, you can save 20 per cent on a single AirTag, or, if you’re prone to misplacing more than just your keys, you can pick up a pack of four AirTags with a 29 per cent discount (was £119, now £84, Amazon.co.uk).\n\nShark stratos anti-hair wrap plus pet pro cordless vacuum: Was £399.99, now £228.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nI’m pleased to see that our best cordless vacuum has been discounted for Prime Day, with a sizeable 43 per cent saving. Our reviewer called the suction power on the Shark stratos “a dream” and praised its powerful LED headlights, which illuminate fine dirt for a super thorough clean. This is the cheapest the vacuum has ever been, so now’s the perfect chance to make a saving.\n\nSony WH-1000XM4 headphones: Was £229, now £168.15, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Sony )\n\nWhile they may be two generations old, the Sony WH-1000XM4s are still regarded as some of the best noise-cancelling headphones you can buy. With elevated comfort and superb sound quality, they were once our top-pick of our round-up of the best headphones and remain a sensible choice, especially with this 27 per cent discount.\n\nAmazon Echo dot: Was £54.99, now £29.44, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nYou can save more than 45 per cent on the latest Echo dot smart speaker with this Prime Day deal. In his review, senior tech critic Alex Lee described music on the Echo Dot as “rich and detailed” and explained how he was able to set up personalised voice recognition for each of his family members. While it’s not the cheapest it’s ever been, I think it’s still worth a look if you’ve been thinking about integrating Alexa into your home.\n\nWeleda skin food: Was £8.95, now £5.65, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon/Theindependent )\n\nLoved by the likes of Hailey Bieber and Victoria Beckham, this accessibly priced nourishing moisturiser is quite the skincare celebrity itself. It’s thick and perfect for dry or rough patches and, our tester found in her pregnancy-safe skincare buys review, that Weleda skin food had “helped heal angry areas of dry, itchy and red skin,” as well as being, “an intensive redeemer that’s nourished and restored a healthy barrier at an affordable price.” And now, it’s been made even more affordable thanks to Prime Day.\n\nKindle paperwhite: Was £169.99, now £134.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( The Independent )\n\nThe best Kindle Amazon makes has been discounted by 20 per cent. The Kindle paperwhite impressed tech critic Steve Hogarty when he reviewed it for his guide to which Kindle to buy. “For most readers, the mid-range Kindle strikes the best balance between cost and features. The inclusion of a softer reading light that can be made warmer for more comfortable reading at night is worth the small step up in price. On top of that, you get a slightly larger display, slimmer bezels, sharper text and a noticeably faster processor,” he noted. It’s worth noting that it was £10 cheaper in December, but this is the cheapest price it’s been this year.\n\nGarnier banana hair food multi-use mask: Was £8.99, now £4.04, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis is a deal worth stocking up on – now with 55 per cent off the price, Garnier’s banana hair food mask can be used as a conditioner, rinse-out mask or leave-in treatment to boost shine and nourish dry ends. Beauty writer Lauren Cunningham tried the pineapple version in her review of the best hair masks and said her hair felt healthier and saw visible results after leaving it on for just 10 minutes.\n\nLumie halo: Was £219, now £169.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nLumie halo light-therapy lamp ( Lumie )\n\nRight now, you can save 22 per cent on the Lumie halo, which featured in our guide to the best SAD lamps. It’s powerful, at its brightest, it creates “the same sort of light you’d get at midday during spring”, noted our review. It features a slider to adjust the colour temperature of the light, and there’s a day mode and night mode – the latter delivers less blue light so shouldn’t negatively affect your sleep.\n\nEufy X10 pro omni robot vacuum cleaner: Was £799, now £549, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nReleased earlier this year, there’s now 31 per cent off the Eufy X10 pro robot vacuum cleaner in the Prime Day sale. Our tests found that this impressive robot is the best robot vacuum you can buy. After putting it to the test for a few weeks, our senior tech writer, Alex Lee, found that its mopping function was far better than most robot vacuums. “It doesn’t just swivel a mop pad around the floor, it properly scrubs the floorboards, while also vacuuming up any dirt or debris”.\n\nKenwood titanium chef patissier xl: Was £799.99, now £599.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Kenwood )\n\nAmazon is serving up a very tempting deal on this Kenwood stand mixer. It’s a pricey model, but this 25 per cent discount makes it more palatable. We’d recommend this for avid bakers, with our review noting that it has an array of settings and comes with two huge mixing bowls and, a standout feature, it even has a warming option.\n\nLG C4 55in: Was £1,199, now £859.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nTech critic David Phelan describes the LG C4 as “best-in-class,” and now it’s at its cheapest-ever price for Amazon Prime Day. In his review of the 65in version, Phelan praised the “pin-sharp” picture and “excellent brightness levels”, as well as its lightweight build that makes it easy to set up.\n\nOral-B pro 3: Was £100, now £46.93, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nAnother budget-friendly toothbrush from Oral-B, the pro 3 “delivers a reliable, thorough clean”, according to our tech critic, Steve Hogarty. He found that his teeth “felt fresh and thoroughly scrubbed” after using it – he couldn’t ask for much more, which is why it earned a spot in our round-up of the best toothbrushes. Amazon has slashed the price by more than 50 per cent, which puts it at around £20 cheaper than its average price for the rest of the year.\n\nNinja foodi 9-in-1 PossiblePan: Was £129.99, now £74.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nMore than 40 per cent has been sliced off the price of the Ninja foodi possible pan this Prime Day. Its “zerostick” non-stick cooking surface performed excellently in our review, with our tester finding that pancakes, vegan sausages and more remained a “stick-free zone”, even when cooked without oil. It’s extremely versatile, so you can use it for everything from boiling to baking, and it’s designed to handle high heats, so rest assured you can can sear and fry without worrying about it damaging the non-stick coating.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra wireless headphones: Was £449.95, now £299.95, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nWhether you want to block out noisy commuters or have some quiet while you’re working, our best wireless headphones for noise cancellation are sure to do the trick. Our senior tech critic, Alex Lee, praised the “sleek” design, “exceedingly comfortable” ear cups and said “we could barely hear anything with these on”. There’s 33 per cent off from Prime Day but you’ll need to be quick, as stock levels are low.\n\nElemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIndyBest writer Ella Duggan praised this cleanser as part of her guide to the best – and it’s currently reduced to its lowest-ever price on Amazon. She found that it was a hassle-free way to remove foundation and mascara, noting that her skin was left “smooth…with a velvety texture”. I’ll certainly be adding this to my basket this Prime Day.\n\nBose soundlink revolve+ II bluetooth speaker: Was £279.95, now £189, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you want to invest in a Bluetooth speaker, you can’t go wrong with our best premium buy from Bose. Reviewer Tamara Hinson praised its “fantastic surround sound”, “slick, seamless design”, and lengthy 17-hour battery life. It rarely drops below £200, so now’s a good chance to take advantage of the 30 per cent saving.\n\nGarnier vitamin C brightening over make-up UV mist, SPF 50+: Was £12.99, now £6.16, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis Garnier vitamin C SPF50 is one of our senior shopping writer’s favourite budget SPF formulas. Now you can get the over-make-up spray version for almost 40 per cent off in the Prime Day sale, arriving just in time to stock up for the summer months. Daisy writes that the cream version “gives premium formulas a serious run for their money” and gives skin a “glowy, lightweight” coverage.\n\nRoberts rambler uno: Was £79.99, now £62.95, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Roberts )\n\nWhen tech writer Ian Evenden reviewed the best DAB radios, the Roberts rambler took the top spots thanks to its rich and full sound, which comes from the “bass speaker integrated into the front-facing array.” This radio is the mini version of our top pick, but still has the same impressive full-range sound, and now has 21 per cent off.\n\nMacBook Air (M4, 2025): Was £999, now £849, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Apple )\n\nAmazon reduced the price of the latest MacBook Air last month, and now, with a further reduction, it’s at one of its lowest prices ever at the online retailer. Tech critic, David Phelan, praised the “preposterously slim, sharply designed and appealingly light” laptop after putting it to the test. It might seem like a modest discount, but it’s rare to see big reductions on the latest Apple tech – and it has actually been reduced to its lowest price.\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you need a stain remover that lifts tough dirt, you can’t go wrong with Vanish oxi action. We put its oxi action whitener to the test and found it “effective on collar grime and food stains”. You won’t be able to get this 1.5kg pack cheaper elsewhere, even on your weekly supermarket shop.\n\nPanda bamboo mattress topper, king: Was £175.95, now £148.50, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Panda )\n\nIf you’re struggling to sleep in the heat, this took the top spot in IndyBest writer Lois Borny’s review of the best cooling mattress toppers. “gel-fused memory foam is engineered to be cooler than regular memory foam, containing gel capsules that draw heat from the body, while extra space allows heat to escape. Plus, the cover is breathable,” she wrote. Having tested it during a June heatwave, you can trust it’s a worthy addition to your sleep set-up this summer (and beyond).\n\nCeraVe AM facial moisturising lotion: Was £16.50, now £9.73, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( CeraVe )\n\nIf you’re after an SPF for sensitive skin, our beauty writer, Lucy Smith, recommends this CeraVe lotion “for those prone to dryness and flaking”. She found that it didn’t pill and, thanks to the addition of niacinamide, is also able to control shine. It’s not at its lowest-ever price, but it’s still a bargain beauty buy at less than £10.\n\nOlaplex no.3 hair perfector: Was £28, now £17.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIn our review of Olaplex’s famous no3 hair perfector, our tester said that the formula is a “modern-day cult classic hair care product” that is “hard to live up to, let alone beat”.

Well worth a spot in my own bathroom cabinet, you can save nearly 40 per cent right now.\n\nWhy you can trust IndyBest’s Amazon Prime Day coverage\n\nIndyBest’s shopping experts track the price of popular products year-round and have covered Amazon Prime Day and other major sales events for years, so we know how to spot a good deal from a bad one. On top of knowing our way around a sale, we are experts in our respective fields. We’ve spent countless hours testing and reviewing everything from TVs, laptops and power tools to vacuums, air fryers and mattresses. Within our Amazon Prime Day guides, we only recommend deals on products we’ve tried and tested from brands we trust. That means we bring you genuine savings on products we think you’ll love as much as we do.\n\nHow to get the best deal on Amazon Prime Day\n\nOur Consumer Editor shares her top tips for shopping on Amazon Prime Day\n\nBefore you shop the Amazon Prime Day sale, make a wish list to avoid buying products that you don’t need. Once the sale starts, use price history tools, such as CamelCamelCamel, to see if you’re truly getting a good deal or if you should hold off buying until the price goes down even further.\n\nIt’s also worth doing a quick Google search to see if you can get a better price at other retailers. Competing retailers often reduce the prices of popular products to match, or even provide a better offer, than Amazon. They may also throw in a longer warranty or free delivery.\n\nFor even more advice, see our top tips for securing the best deals on Amazon Prime Day\n\nWhat is Amazon Prime Day?\n\nAmazon Prime Day is a four-day sale event for Prime members. It’s usually held twice a year – once in the summer and again in October to kick-start Christmas shopping. The event features deals across top brands, from Apple to Dyson, as well as offers on its bestselling own tech, including Kindle and Echo dot smart speakers.\n\nDo you need to be a Prime member?\n\nIf you want to take advantage of Prime Day discounts, you must be a Prime member. A Prime membership costs £8.99 a month, or £95 if you pay annually. If you’re between 18 to 22-years-old, this is half the standard price, and you get a 6-month trial to see if it’s for you. Perks include unlimited one-day delivery, access to Prime Video and the chance to shop Prime-exclusive deals.\n\nHowever, if you’re unsure about adding another monthly cost to your bills, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial. This will give you full access to all the Prime member benefits, and you can cancel at any time during your trial to avoid being charged when it expires. Just bear in mind that this only works if you haven’t signed up for the free trial before.\n\nShop for more Prime Day savings with our hand-picked best Apple deals, best Ninja deals, best air fryer deals and more",

      "text": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Email * SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice\n\nBreakfast cereal could use a lucky charm.\n\nU.S. sales of the colorfully packaged morning staple have been in a decades-long decline, a trend back in the spotlight with news that Italian confectioner Ferrero Group plans to purchase the American company that makes Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Froot Loops, Rice Krispies and other familiar brands.\n\nExcept for a brief period during the coronavirus pandemic, when many workers were home and had time to sit down with a bowl of cereal and milk, sales of cold cereal have steadily fallen for at least 25 years, experts say.\n\nIn the 52 weeks ending July 3, 2021, Americans bought nearly 2.5 billion boxes of cereal, according to market research company Nielsen IQ. In the same period this year, the number was down more than 13% to 2.1 billion.\n\nCereal has been struggling for multiple reasons. The rise of more portable options like Nutri-Grain bars and Clif Bars – which both went on sale in the early 1990s – made it easier for consumers to grab breakfast on the go.\n\nConcerns about food processing and sugar intake have also dimmed some consumers’ enthusiasm for cereals. One cup of Lucky Charms contains 24% of a consumer’s daily recommended intake of sugar, for example.\n\n“Cereal finds it really hard to get out from underneath that,” said Tom Rees, global insight manager for staple foods at the consulting company Euromonitor. “It can't escape the fact that it doesn't look like a natural food. You have to create it and form it.”\n\nRees noted that for decades, cereal manufacturers focused on adding vitamins and minerals to build cereal's health credentials. But consumers now are looking for simplified ingredient lists.\n\nArtificial dyes — like the petroleum-based colors that brighten Froot Loops — have also come under fire. Last fall, dozens of people rallied outside WK Kellogg's Battle Creek, Michigan, headquarters demanding that it remove artificial dyes from its cereals. Kellogg and General Mills — another major U.S. cereal maker — have since pledged to phase out artificial dyes.\n\nAdd to that, consumers are expanding their idea of what breakfast can be. Yogurt and shakes have replaced the traditional bacon and eggs. Kenton Barello, a vice president at the market research firm YouGov, said his polling shows that Generation Z consumers, who were born between 1997 and 2007, eat more vegetables for breakfast than other generations.\n\nBarello said YouGov’s polling also shows that members of Gen Z are less likely to eat breakfast but still buy ready-to-eat cereal, suggesting they’re eating it as a snack or for other meals.\n\n“With younger generations, there are differences in their relationship with food and these eating moments,” Barello said. “They are going about breakfast in a different way than Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers.”\n\nCereal's struggles are part of what led to the breakup of the Kellogg Company. In 2023, the century-old company that put Battle Creek, Michigan, on the map split into two companies. Kellanova took popular snack brands like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop-Tarts as well as international cereals, and WK Kellogg made cereals for the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean.\n\nIn 2024, M&M's maker Mars Inc. announced a plan to buy Kellanova for more than $30 billion. That plan has cleared U.S. regulators but is still awaiting regulatory approval in Europe. WK Kellogg was left to try to rejuvenate the cereal business.\n\nThe sale of WK Kellogg to Ferrero doesn't mean supermarket cereal aisles are at risk of extinction. Packaged food companies have options for turning around their soggy cereal sales, Rees said. He thinks Kellogg's Mashups line, which mixed brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops into one box, appeal to younger consumers, who tend to like interesting flavor combinations.\n\nThe market may also have a fragmented future, according to Rees. Companies may have to accept that younger buyers want a sweet-and-spicy cereal while older buyers might want a Keto-friendly option.\n\n“The future might be realizing that the era of ‘This brand will serve everybody’ isn't going to happen,” Rees said.\n\nJulia Mills, a food analyst with the consulting company Mintel, thinks the shrinking population of children in the U.S. gives cereal makers the opportunity to shift to more sophisticated flavors and packaging. Cereal could be positioned as a fancy topping for yogurt, for example, or a fiber-rich food that can improve gut health.\n\nSome niche cereal brands, like high-fiber Poop Like a Champion cereal and high-protein, zero-sugar Magic Spoon, are already doing that. But legacy brands say they shouldn't be counted out.\n\nJeffrey Harmening, the chairman and chief executive officer of Cheerios maker General Mills, said his company considered trying to acquire Magic Spoon. Instead, it made high-protein versions of Cheerios, which now outsells Magic Spoon.\n\n“The key to longer term is, honestly, is giving consumers more of what they want,” Harmening said during a conference call with investors in March.",

If you’re after AirPods at their lowest-ever price, you can count on me to be the first to report on the discount.\n\nThe best Apple deals in the Amazon Prime Day 2025 sale are:\n\nApple AirPods Pro 2: Was £229, now £179, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £229, now £179, Amazon.co.uk MacBook Air M4 (2025): Was £999, now £849, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £999, now £849, Amazon.co.uk Apple iPad 11th-generation: Was £329, now £284, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £329, now £284, Amazon.co.uk Apple iPhone 16e 256GB: Was £699, now £594, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £699, now £594, Amazon.co.uk Apple Watch Ultra 2: Was £799, now £659, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £799, now £659, Amazon.co.uk Apple AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation: Was £179, now £149, Amazon.co.uk\n\nApple AirPods Pro 2: Was £229, now £179, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Apple )\n\nReduced to their all-time low price, I’d recommend snapping these up while you can. Praised by tech critic David Phelan, they boast better audio and better active noise cancellation than the AirPods 4. David’s review found that they feature some really neat adaptive audio features that react to your environment in real time. I know all that first-hand, too; these are actually the earbuds I wear every day, and I love that they’re being updated with new features all the time.\n\nApple iPad 11th-generation: Was £329, now £284, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Apple )\n\nLaunched in March, the all-new 11th-generation iPad has dropped to its lowest-ever price this Prime Day. Replacing the 10th-gen model, it boasts a faster A16 Bionic chip, USB-C charging, and double the storage, with 128GB as standard. It still features the same bright 10.9in Liquid Retina display, making it the best-value iPad in Apple’s line-up right now and a steal at this price.\n\nApple Watch series 10: Was £529, now £425, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nWhen tech critic David Phelan reviewed the best Apple watches earlier this month, this model came out on top with five stars. He named the watch model as being the “classiest, sleekest manifestation” yet, and was particularly impressed by the great features, like sleep tracking, a heart rate monitor, and other health and fitness additions. The 46mm version is currently reduced by more than £100.\n\nMacBook Air M4 (2025): Was £999, now £849, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you’re looking to upgrade your laptop this Prime Day, you’ll be pleased to hear that Apple’s latest and greatest MacBook Air has been slashed by £150, bringing it down to an all-time low price. In his rave review, tech critic David Phelan found the laptop “Preposterously slim, sharply designed and appealingly light, with battery life that goes on and on”. He also loved the faster processor and improved webcam. It’s really simple; according to David, “this is Apple’s best MacBook Air yet.”\n\nApple AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation: Was £179, now £149, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nI’ve also spotted a discount on the AirPods 4 – Apple’s latest wireless in-ear headphones. Right now, they’re at their lowest ever price on Amazon and you won’t find them this cheap anywhere else. In his review, tech critic, David Phelan, found that the music quality of these headphones was “exemplary”. While the noise cancellation doesn’t quite match that of the AirPods pro 2, “it certainly quells background noise effectively”. This best-ever deal will save you £30.\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Was £799, now £659, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been slashed by a huge £140 for Prime Day. In his review, tech critic David Phelan called it “a big chunky wearable that’s perfect for extreme sport enthusiasts,” as it has a two-day battery life that’s perfect for hiking. It boasts a bright 3000-nit display, a sleep apnoea-detection feature to track breathing irregularities over time, and an upgraded S9 processor, making it faster and last longer than other watches. You also get a neat double-tap gesture feature for one-handed control.\n\nApple iPhone 16e 256GB: Was £699, now £594, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThe 128GB version of the iPhone 16e has now sold out at Amazon, but there’s still a £105 saving to be had on the 256GB model. Apple’s all-new budget phone is better than the iPhone SE in every way, said tech critic David Phelan in his review. “It's not an upgraded iPhone SE, but an awful lot more, from more storage to a bigger display.”\n\nApple iPhone 16: Was £799, now £699, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nLooking to save big on the iPhone 16 this Prime Day? The 128GB model has already dipped below £700 thanks to a 13 per cent discount, with similar savings to be found on the larger storage options. In his review of the iPhone 16, tech critic David Phelan praised the smartphone’s “extremely useful camera control, the funky audio options and faster wireless charging.” He added, “feature after feature that you might have expected to be Pro-only is on the iPhone 16,” making it an excellent option if you’d been saving up for one of the pricier models.\n\nApple AirTag, 4-pack: Was £119, now £84, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis is the lowest price I’ve seen on a pack of four AirTags since Black Friday last year. If you’re like me and constantly losing things, these are a game-changer. In my review, I raved about how you can track your stuff with precise turn-by-turn directions in an augmented-reality environment inside the Find My app. These AirTags are a lifesaver if you ever misplace your wallet or your keys.\n\nApple pencil pro: Was £129, now £109, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nAmazon is offering a rare £20 off the Apple pencil pro, which is the brand’s top-of-the-line stylus for the latest iPads. Its squeeze gestures, haptic feedback and double‑tap shortcuts make it ideal for creatives, students, or anyone serious about sketching or note-taking. It's a small discount, but the pencil pro almost never goes on sale, so if you’ve been looking to buy one, now's the time.\n\nApple Mac mini: Was £599, now £499, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you want to upgrade your desktop set-up, there’s a small reduction on the Mac mini desktop computer. It has Apple’s latest M4 chip, and its mini dimensions mean that it’ll slot perfectly into a small home office. It’s a modest price drop of 17 per cent, so we’ll let you know if there are further reductions.\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB: Was £999, now £899, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nI’ve spotted a 10 per cent discount on the latest iPhone, the iPhone 16 Pro. This isn't the cheapest it’s been, with the price recently falling as low as £829. However, this is still an excellent deal that saves and saves you £100. In his review, The Independent’s technology editor, Andrew Griffin, said it was “snappy and fast”, and praised its professional features and photo and video improvements. Best of all, it isn't limited to Prime members – anyone can take advantage of this deal.\n\nApple Magic Mouse: Was £79, now £59, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nA must-have accessory for any Mac or MacBook owner, the Magic Mouse makes working and browsing seamless thanks to its multi-touch surface and optimised foot design. It’s also wireless and rechargeable, so you can throw it in your bag for on-the-go. You can grab it in the Amazon Prime sale for £20 off.\n\nApple Magic Keyboard: Was £99, now £75, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThere’s £24 off Apple’s magic keyboard in this year’s Prime sale. Its sleek, wireless design offers a comfortable typing experience and the internal battery is said to last around a month between charges. It also includes a USB-C port and a woven USB-C charging cable for quick pairing and power.\n\nApple AirPods 4 wireless earbuds: Was £129, now £113, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you’re looking to invest in a pair of AirPods at a more affordable price, Amazon is currently offering the entry-level model (without noise cancellation) with a 12 per cent discount. That’s £36 cheaper than the upgraded version (also featured in our roundup), yet you still get up to five hours of listening time, a water-resistant design, voice isolation and a charging case that holds up to 30 hours of power.\n\nApple magic keyboard folio for iPad: Was £249, now £197, Amazon.co.uk\n\nApple magic keyboard folio for iPad ( Apple / Amazon )\n\nIf you own an iPad 10th gen and need a laptop, but can't stretch to a brand new Macbook, this keyboard represents a more cost-effective middle ground. It transforms your tablet into a laptop of sorts, allowing you to type and use the trackpad while also serving as a protective case when you’re on the go. This Prime Day price of £197 matches the lowest price we've seen on Amazon.\n\nLooking for more deals? These are the best air fryer deals to shop in Amazon’s Prime Day sale",

Read our Privacy notice\n\nYou’ve got a few more hours to shop the best air fryer deals in the Amazon Prime Day 2025 sale, and it’s here in my dedicated shopping guide that you’ll find the top tried-and-tested picks for less.\n\nNot sure which model is best for you? Well, a good air fryer starts at around the £60 mark, but some of the best models can cost upwards of £200, which is why Prime Day is the perfect time to invest. Whether you need a compact model for couples cooking or a dual-drawer appliance for big family meals, there are plenty of bargains on offer.\n\nRight now, you can save more than 30 per cent on Ninja’s double stack XL air fryer (was £269.99, now £184.99, Amazon.co.uk), which received high praise when appliance expert Katie Gregory put it to the test. If you’re looking for something smaller, you won’t want to miss out on the discount on Salter’s compact air fryer (was £34.99, now £29.49, Amazon.co.uk), which is perfect for solo dwellers.\n\nIf neither of those super savings takes your fancy, I’ll be on hand throughout Amazon’s sale to bring you the best air fryer offers from trusted brands. Keep scrolling for the top deals.\n\nFollow live: The latest Amazon Prime Day offers as they drop\n\nWhy you can trust IndyBest’s Amazon Prime Day air fryer deals coverage\n\nThe IndyBest team have been testing the top air fryer models since 2019, comparing Ninja models to budget buys, proving we know how to spot easy-to-clean models, a multi-functional buy and a great bargain. The team and I also track the price of air fryers year-round so that we can spot a good deal from a bad one, which is crucial for Amazon Prime Day. We would only ever recommend models we’ve tried and tested or that come from brands and retailers we trust.\n\nThe best air fryer deals in the Amazon Prime Day 2025 sale are:\n\nNinja foodi max dual zone digital air fryer: Was £239.99, now £153.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £239.99, now £153.99, Amazon.co.uk Ninja double stack XL air fryer: Was £269.99, now £194.63, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £269.99, now £194.63, Amazon.co.uk Tower T17190GRP Vortx XL dual stack air fryer: Was £149.99, now £109.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £149.99, now £109.99, Amazon.co.uk Tefal easy fry dual zone digital air fryer: Was £129.99, now £94.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £129.99, now £94.99, Amazon.co.uk Panasonic NF-CC600 air fryer: Was £124, now £84.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nWas £124, now £84.99, Amazon.co.uk Ninja foodi flexdrawer air fryer: Was £269.99, now £189.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nNinja foodi max dual zone digital air fryer: Was £239.99, now £153.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nWe’ve spotted another Ninja air fryer deal, and this time it’s on the foodi max dual zone air fryer. The two-drawer air fryer has six cooking functions and a spacious 9.5l capacity. Our reviewer was impressed that the six-in-one appliance “has every cooking setting you could possibly need” and liked that it “takes the guesswork out of timing and temperature”.

Its generous 6L capacity is perfect for family-sized portions, while the handy viewing window lets you keep an eye on your food without letting out precious heat. The real star here is the gentle steam function, which helps keep everything from chicken to vegetables juicy and tender – a feature you rarely see at this price point.\n\nCosori dual blaze twinfry air fryer: Was £249.99, now £189.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Cosori )\n\n“With a whopping 10l capacity, this air fryer is ideal for larger families,” said IndyBest reviewer Rachael Penn.

Amazon’s Prime Day sale means you can now pick up this air fryer with a 26 per cent discount.\n\nRead more: Best Ninja deals in the Amazon Prime Day sale\n\nTower T17190GRP Vortx XL dual stack air fryer: Was £149.99, now £109.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nTower has followed in the footsteps of Ninja with its own double-stacked air fryer. It’s made up of two 5.5l baskets, with plenty of space to cook family-sized meals, and pre-set cooking functions that include fries, wings, steak, veg, bake and DIY. You can get it for close to £100 in the Prime Day sale, which is significantly cheaper than Ninja’s double-stacked offering.\n\nTefal easy fry dual zone digital air fryer: Was £129.99, now £94.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nAmazon has knocked 27 per cent off the price of the Tefal easy-fry dual-zone air fryer, taking it to its cheapest ever price of £94.99. The good news is that this deal isn’t exclusive to Prime Day, so you may even be able to snap it up once the sale is over. With two drawers, you can cook two items simultaneously, in the same way or on different settings. Tester Katie Gregoryreviewed the XXL version and praised its “easy-to-use controls, the dishwasher-safe baskets and trays, and the family-sized proportions”.\n\nRussell Hobbs XXL family rapid digital air fryer: Was £159.99, now £69.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nRusell Hobbs’ cooking appliances frequently make it into our round-up of the best air fryers, so we were pleased to spot one at more than half price in the Prime Day sale. This model has a single 8l drawer, 10 cooking functions and even an audible shake reminder for the foods that need it. If you’re looking for a no-frills air fryer for less than £100, we think you can’t go too wrong with this deal.\n\nNinja foodi flexdrawer air fryer: Was £269.99, now £189.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis dual air fryer has a huge, single 10.4l drawer, which can be split in half to separately cook both components of your meal, such as salmon and vegetables. Our reviewer was impressed with its versatility and wrote: “If you want an air fryer that can do it all, this is it”. It’s been reduced by £80 in the Prime Day sale, which is an even bigger discount than we saw back in March during Amazon’s Spring Sale.\n\nNinja foodi max 14-in-1 SmartLid multi cooker: Was £309.99, now £199.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nNinja’s multi cooker has been slashed in price, with a 35 per cent Prime Day discount. The appliance comes with 14 functions, including air fry, pressure cook, slow cook and steam. The combi mode pairs steam with convection cooking for fast, crispy results. Large enough for six portions of food, it’s ideal for hosting, too. Take advantage of this deal and you can save £100 on the multi-purpose appliance.\n\nSalter EK2817 2l compact air fryer: Was £34.99, now £29.49, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nConsidering air fryers can set you back hundreds of pounds, this deal on a model from IndyBest's tried and tested brand, Salter, is seriously impressive. Now less than £30, the compact 2l model is perhaps best suited to solo dwellers. While it doesn’t come with all the bells and whistles of some other devices, it does have an auto-shutoff function, a timer that can be set up to 30 minutes, and a temperature dial.\n\nNinja air fryer max pro, 6.2l: Was £169.99, now £99.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis sleek Ninja air fryer is reduced by 41 per cent in the Prime Day sale, saving you £70. It’s roomy enough for four portions, and has six cooking functions, including roast, bake, and reheat. We haven't tested this particular model, but we've loved every other Ninja air fryer we've tested.\n\nCosori 4.7l 9-in-1 compact air fryer oven: Was £99.99, now £66.49, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( `Amazon )\n\nCosori’s multi-purpose air fryer is discounted by 34 per cent. The brand comes approved by IndyBest, with one of its other models landing a spot in our guide to the best air fryers (you can check out our review of the dual blaze twinfry air fryer here), so we’re fairly confident this won’t be a dud. It’s suitable for families as it’s big enough to cook up to four portions of food, and it can also defrost, reheat and more.\n\nInstant vortex digital air fryer: Was £99.99, now £46.20, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Instant )\n\nHere’s a massive 54 per cent saving on the Instant Vortex air fryer. From the makers of the Instant Pot, this model features a handy window to help you get crispy, perfectly cooked results without opening the drawer and releasing the heat. A brilliant all-rounder for anyone looking to get into air frying, this is fantastic value at just £46.20.\n\nOur Place wonder oven: Was £195, now £155, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nTrendy kitchenware and appliance brand Our Place shot to fame for its multi-purpose always pan, but it’s also worth considering one of its appliances, the wonder oven. It’s designed to do everything from toasting and broiling to baking and even air frying. Loved for its speedy pre-heating time and compact design, the wonder oven is reduced by 21 per cent this Prime Day, saving you £40.\n\nTefal easy fry max air fryer: Was £79.99, now £49.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nYou won’t find an air fryer from a top-rated brand like Tefal getting much more affordable than this. Now discounted to just shy of £50, Tefal’s easy fry max air fryer has a roomy 5l capacity which can cook up to six portions of food, and features a digital control panel and 10 cooking functions for easy peasy meal prep.\n\n( Amazon )\n\nLooking for an air fryer that does more than just fry? Look no further. The Ninja Speedi has 10 functions, including air fry, steam, grill, bake, roast, sear, slow cook and more. Whatever you need to cook, it’ll help you feed your family in minutes - in fact, Ninja says the Speedi can cook a three-part meal for four in fifteen minutes. It’s had a huge 53 per cent price drop, taking it to its lowest ever price on Amazon.\n\nNinja crispi 3.8l portable air fryer: Was £179.99, now £119.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you want the perks of a premium air-fryer without sacrificing worktop space, the Ninja crispi is for you. Recently reviewed by our senior tech writer, Alex Lee, this impressive portable model not only looks the part with its sleek glass cooking compartments, but it cooks food to a “delightful crisp”. It's easy to clean and store thanks to the modular design, and the cooking compartments double up as food storage. It’s well worth snapping up for 33 per cent off in the Prime Day sale, as it's now at the lowest price we've ever seen.\n\nTower vortx dual basket air fryer: Was £119.99, now £78, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThis budget-friendly dual air fryer is now even cheaper, with Amazon knocking 35 per cent off its price in the Prime Day sale. We tested the 8l model (this one is 9l) that has two viewing windows. Our reviewer, Katie, praised “the simple layout of the digital touchscreen” as well as how easy it was to set the dual temperature controls. The model with the viewing windows will cost you more, at £87. However if you can do without them, you’ll benefit from Prime Day savings.\n\n( Amazon )\n\nThe 10.4l combined capacity of both the air fryer drawers in this model should be enough to comfortably feed a family of six. Our reviewer, Katie, praised the PFAS-free drawer that “moves away from the traditional non-stick surfaces.” On top of that, there are shake reminders and an automatic keep-warm function. The air fryer is now available at its cheapest ever price for Amazon Prime Day.\n\nZwilling air fryer: Was £139, now £111.20, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nIf you're running short on kitchen counter space, this compact 4l Zwilling air fryer is worth a look. Chips came out “perfectly crispy”, according to our tester, Rachael, while the temperature accuracy was spot on. Amazon has slashed the price of this air fryer by 20 per cent – it’s not the cheapest it’s ever been, but it is still a fair saving.\n\nCosori turboblaze 6l air fryer: Was £159.99, now £94.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nCosori turboblaze 6l air fryer ( Cosori / Amazon )\n\nAnother Cosori deal, the single-drawer turboblaze offers a decent 6l capacity for less than £100 in Amazon's sale. The appliance has nine functions – air fry, roast, grill, frozen, reheat, preheat, proof, bake, dehydrate and keep warm – with the controls set on the top of the machine. This air fryer also promises speedy, energy-efficient cooking. Although we haven’t reviewed this specific model, our testers have tried and rated other Cosori air fryers, so it's a brand you can trust.\n\nRussell Hobbs Satisfry XXL air fryer: Was £159.99, now £69.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\nRussell Hobbs Satisfry XXL air fryer ( Russell Hobbs / Amazon )\n\nRussell Hobbs products feature regularly in our kitchenware roundups, including our guide to the best dual air fryers. This enormous single-drawer option has an 8L capacity – helpful if you’re feeding a family or cooking in bulk for the week ahead. The 56 per cent discount isn’t all it seems, with the product usually selling for £85-£100 on Amazon. But given the Prime Day price is not far off the air fryer’s lowest ever selling point of £65.57, it’s still a good deal.\n\nBosch series 6 air fryer XXL: Was £159.99, now £98.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n( Amazon )\n\nBosch is already a go-to for high-quality kitchen appliances. This impressive air fryer has been reduced to less than £100 for a limited time. It features a generous 7.2l cooking compartment with an illuminated viewing window so you can watch your food as it cooks to perfection. Even better, it’s dishwasher safe for quick and easy cleaning.\n\nWhen is Amazon Prime Day 2025?\n\nAmazon Prime Day kicked off on Tuesday 8 July, and will last four days until Friday 11 July.

Read our Privacy notice\n\nCaptain Reece James is convinced Chelsea can defy the odds and pull off a huge upset against Paris St Germain to be crowned world champions.\n\nThe Blues face the exhilarating and in-form French outfit in Sunday’s Club World Cup final in New York and know the odds are stacked against them.\n\nPSG are on the brink of a quintuple, having already won the Champions League and three domestic trophies.\n\nIn addition, Luis Enrique’s side all but replicated their stunning 5-0 rout of Inter Milan in the Champions League final by thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 in Wednesday’s semi-final.\n\nYet form and reputation are of no concern to James, who has no doubt Chelsea will be ready for the challenge at the MetLife Stadium.\n\nThe 25-year-old said: “This game is a super high-level game. They are one of the hottest teams in the world at the moment. They are down as strong favourites.\n\n“But I have been in finals where I have played for the favourites and not come out on top, so this doesn’t mean much to me and I don’t care, to be honest, that everyone is ‘bigging up’ our opposition.\n\n“PSG have beaten all the English teams, they have an amazing team, but we have an amazing team and have surprised a lot of people.\n\n“We’ve come a long way on our journey from where we started. We are preparing right and going there to win.\n\n“I believe we will go toe-to-toe. Stats, data, favourites and not favourites don’t mean anything to our team.”\n\nJames has also declared himself fit after clarifying the issue that saw him miss the quarter-final win over Palmeiras.\n\nThe right-back had been on the teamsheet in Philadelphia last Friday but pulled out after the warm up.\n\n“Just to be clear, I wasn’t injured so let’s put that to bed,” he said. “I wasn’t feeling so good in the warm-up, with my history.\n\n“I could have played but it was a warning. It would have been ‘why did I not listen?’ (if I got injured), so I decided not to take an unnecessary risk.”\n\nChelsea are continuing to monitor the fitness of key midfielder Moises Caicedo, who suffered an ankle injury in the closing stages of Tuesday’s semi-final victory over Fluminense.\n\nManager Enzo Maresca said: “Moises is such an important player for us. This morning he trained but he couldn’t take part in the session fully. We hope he can play on Sunday.”\n\nThe match will be Chelsea’s 64th of a long season that has also seen them secure Champions League qualification and win the Europa Conference League.\n\nMaresca, who has now been in charge for one year, feels the side have changed how people perceive them.\n\nHe said: “One year ago no-one was talking about Chelsea and football. Everyone was talking about Chelsea (and) big squad, big money, these kinds of things.\n\n“Now, no-one is talking about this. Now everyone is talking about Chelsea, the way we play, the way we win games, and this is personally the biggest achievement of this season.”",

There, the president joked that immigrants who attempt to escape the prison could be eaten by alligators.\n\nFlorida Republicans have also used the detention center to boost fundraising, selling branded merchandise bearing its name.\n\nNow, Wenski has hit back against those who have praised the pop-up prison, branding it “intentionally provocative” and “unbecoming.”\n\nopen image in gallery President Donald Trump visits Alligator Alcatraz in Florida with Governor Ron DeSantis and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ( AP )\n\n“It is alarming to see enforcement tactics that treat all irregular immigrants as dangerous criminals,” Wenski said.\n\n“It is unbecoming of public officials and corrosive of the common good to speak of the deterrence value of ‘alligators and pythons’ at the Collier-Dade facility,” he added.\n\nThe center is designed to hold 3,000 to 5,000 people, but officials are currently detaining people inside large metal enclosures covered by tents. Wenski said he’s concerned these tents can’t protect people from Florida’s extreme weather, and noted that the detention center is in an isolated area far from a hospital.\n\nopen image in gallery Archbishop Thomas Wenski has criticized public officials who have promoted the \"deterrence value of ‘alligators and pythons’\" at the detention center ( Getty Images )\n\nWenski isn’t the only one sounding the alarm on the conditions there either.\n\nLeamsy “La Figura” Izquierdo, a Cuban artist who was arrested in Miami last week, told CBS News that detainees have “no water to take a bath,” are fed once a day with maggot-infested food and don’t have access to toothpaste.\n\n“They only brought a meal once a day and it has maggots,” he said. “They never take off the lights for 24 hours. The mosquitoes are as big as elephants.”\n\nAn unnamed Colombian detainee also told CBS News he was denied access to his medication for days.\n\n“I'm on the edge of losing my mind. I've gone three days without taking my medicine,\" he said. \"It is impossible to sleep with this white light that's on all day.”\n\nopen image in gallery Many on the right have praised the controversial facility, and have even sold merch baring its name. ( AP )\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has denounced the center and raised concerns about the conditions.\n\n“This project dehumanizes people, strips them of their rights, and diverts public dollars from the services our communities need,” Bacardi Jackson, the executive director of the ACLU of Florida, said.\n\nSeveral other Catholic leaders have also spoken out against the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nSan Bernardino Bishop Alberto Rojas said members of the nation’s sixth-largest Catholic community are excused from attending mass over “genuine fear” of immigration enforcement actions that have rocked communities across Los Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nLos Angeles Archbishop José Gomez has also accused the administration of having “no immigration policy beyond the stated goal of deporting thousands of people each day.”\n\n“This is not policy, it is punishment, and it can only result in cruel and arbitrary outcomes,” Gomez continued. “Already we are hearing stories of innocent fathers and mothers being wrongly deported, with no recourse to appeal.”",

Read our Privacy notice\n\nThe Trump administration is suing the state of California to block animal welfare laws that it says unconstitutionally helped send egg prices soaring. But a group that spearheaded the requirements pushed back, blaming bird flu for the hit to consumers' pocketbooks.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in California on Wednesday, challenges voter initiatives that passed in 2018 and 2008. They require that all eggs sold in California come from cage-free hens.\n\nThe Trump administration says the law imposes burdensome red tape on the production of eggs and egg products across the country because of the state's outsize role in the national economy.\n\n“It is one thing if California passes laws that affects its own State, it is another when those laws affect other States in violation of the U.S. Constitution,” U.S. Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement Thursday. \"Thankfully, President Trump is standing up against this overreach.”\n\nEgg prices soared last year and earlier this year due in large part to bird flu, which has forced producers to destroy nearly 175 million birds since early 2022. But prices have come down sharply recently. While the Trump administration claims credit for that, seasonal factors are also important. Avian influenza, which is spread by wild birds, tends to spike during the spring and fall migrations and drop in summer.\n\n“Pointing fingers won’t change the fact that it is the President’s economic policies that have been destructive,\" the California Department of Justice said in a statement Friday. \"We’ll see him in court.”\n\nThe average national price for a dozen Grade A eggs declined to $5.12 in April and $4.55 in May after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the May price was still 68.5% higher than a year earlier.\n\n“Trump’s back to his favorite hobby: blaming California for literally everything,” Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a social media post.\n\nThe federal complaint alleges that California contributed to the rise in egg prices with regulations that forced farmers across the country to adopt more expensive production practices. The lawsuit also asserts that it is the federal government's legal prerogative to regulate egg production. So it seeks to permanently block enforcement of the California regulations that flowed from the two ballot measures.\n\n“Americans across the country have suffered the consequences of liberal policies causing massive inflation for everyday items like eggs,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will use the full extent of federal law to ensure that American families are free from oppressive regulatory burdens and restore American prosperity.”\n\nWhile 2018's Proposition 12 also banned the sale of pork and veal in California from animals raised in cages that don’t meet minimum size requirements, the lawsuit only focuses on the state's egg rules.\n\nHumane World for Animals, which was named the Humane Society of the United States when it spearheaded the passage of Proposition 12, says avian influenza and other factors drove up egg prices, not animal welfare laws. And it says much of the U.S. egg industry went cage-free anyway because of demand from consumers who don't want eggs from hens confined to tiny spaces.\n\n“California has prohibited the sale of cruelly produced eggs for more than a decade — law that has been upheld by courts at every level, including the Supreme Court. Blaming 2025 egg prices on these established animal welfare standards shows that this case is about pure politics, not constitutional law,” Sara Amundson, president of the Humane World Action Fund, said in a statement.\n\nThe American Egg Board, which represents the industry, said Friday that it will monitor the progress of the lawsuit while continuing to comply with California’s laws, and that it appreciates Rollins’ efforts to support farmers in their fight against bird flu and to stabilize the egg supply.\n\n“Egg farmers have been both responsive and responsible in meeting changing demand for cage-free eggs, while supporting all types of egg production, and continuing to provide options in the egg case for consumers,” the board said in a statement.",

Instead, it was a decision made by the show’s creative team.\n\nHBO told The Independent in a statement: “Dr. Collins is a fourth-year resident at a teaching hospital in season one and will not be at the shift in season two.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted Ifeachor’s representatives for comment.\n\nopen image in gallery (L-R) Noah Wyle as Dr. Robby and Tracy Ifeachor as Dr. Collins in ‘The Pitt’ season one ( HBO Max )\n\nThe casting update comes days after Ifeachor called it a “blessing to be a part of this first and foundational season of #ThePitt on @hbomax,” in an Instagram post.\n\n“It was an absolute privilege to play Dr. Heather Collins in such a groundbreaking season and piece. Thank you to everyone who has watched & supported Season 1 & shared their stories with me,” she wrote.\n\nThe Pitt follows a group of Pennsylvania doctors and surgeons working at an underfunded Pittsburgh hospital. Each episode uniquely centers on one hour of a 15-hour shift.\n\nIfeachor appeared in the first 11 episodes of season one. Her character, a senior resident at the hospital, is introduced as a single woman who’s been undergoing rounds of IVF to start a family. It’s revealed that she was once in a romantic relationship with series lead Dr. Robby (played by ER alum Noah Wyle).\n\nThe two remain close, and Dr. Collin is last seen opening up about her miscarriage and past abortion to Dr. Robby, who sends her home to rest and recover.\n\nLast month, it was announced that season two would be introducing The L Word: Generation Q’s Sepideh Moafi as a series regular.

Scott Gemmill and executive produced byJohn Wells and Wyle, is facing an ongoing lawsuit.\n\nIn August 2024, the estate of ER creator Michael Crichton filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros Television, Gemmill, Wells, and Wyle, alleging that The Pitt is an unauthorized reboot of ER.\n\nThey accused Wells of a “personal betrayal,” arguing in the lawsuit that he and Wyle, who played Dr. John Carter in ER, dreamed up The Pitt after the Crichton estate blocked plans to bring back the original show.\n\nWarner Bros. has denied the accusations, calling them “baseless.”\n\nWyle later broke his silence on the lawsuit in April, admitting that it made him “profoundly sad and disappointed.”\n\n“This taints the legacy, and it shouldn’t have,” he told Variety. “At one point, this could have been a partnership. And when it wasn’t a partnership, it didn’t need to turn acrimonious. But on the 30th anniversary of ER, I’ve never felt less celebratory of that achievement than I do this year.”",

      "text": "Your questions on ergonomic office chairs answered\n\nWhich is the best ergonomic office chair?\n\nWith its no-sweat assembly and solid build quality, the Boulies nubi lite is a great choice for dedicated home workers who will be able to feel the support in all the right areas. One of the most comfortable chairs on test, it has all the adjustability you will need to see you through your working day, without any stiffness.\n\nHowever, if you have a larger budget, the Humanscale freedom and the Herman miller mirra 2 butterfly really offer tangible ergonomics that get to work as soon as you sit down.\n\nWhat is the best brand of ergonomic office chair?\n\nI’ve been testing ergonomic office chairs since 2020. I’ve found that the best brand of ergonomic office chair is Boulies (with its nubi lite chair taking the top spot in this guide for good reason). But I’d also recommend Flexispot and Herman Miller (if your budget can stretch), along with the other tried and tested chairs in this review.\n\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic office chair\n\nThe best ergonomic office chairs keep you comfortable and reduce strain when working at a desk for long periods. That means your chair should adapt to your body while still offering ample support. Here are the top features to look for in an ergonomic chair.\n\nSeat height: The height of the seat should allow your feet to rest flat on the floor, thighs parallel to the ground.\n\nThe height of the seat should allow your feet to rest flat on the floor, thighs parallel to the ground.

Mesh or breathable fabric upholstery keeps you cool and comfortable even on warm days. Cushioning: A good chair balances support and comfort. Too firm and you'll be squirming. Too soft and you'll sink in and slouch.\n\nA good chair balances support and comfort. Too firm and you'll be squirming. Too soft and you'll sink in and slouch. Casters: Smooth-rolling casters let you move around easily, without straining.\n\nDo I need adjustable armrests?\n\nLet’s start by saying there are pros and cons to having armrests. If you use them properly, they can support your limbs and relieve your back when seated. However, they can also encourage shoulder shrugging if set too high and can have the effect of a leaning posture if one of them is set slightly higher than the other.\n\nYour elbows should be in line with the desk, so, for those of us where that’s not the case, adjustable armrests can come in handy in helping you find the correct setup. To make your working-from-home space a place of comfort, make sure your armrests are positioned correctly. It’s the last thing you should be adjusting, and ideally, they should sit just below your elbow when your hands are resting in your lap (a lot lower than most would think).\n\nFor the best and most comfy setup, you would switch between using the armrest to, well, rest your arms on and going without during your day.\n\nHow to protect your carpet from office chairs\n\nHigh-quality office chairs can be quite heavy, and therefore leave unwanted marks and imprints on our lovely carpets. A great way to get around this is by using an office chair mat, creating a level of protection between your chair and the floor, helping to reduce friction and damage to the carpet fibres. For chairs without wheels, chair coasters offer similar protection by protecting the space under each stationary chair leg.\n\nSetting up your office chair to avoid back pain\n\nFirst off, the height of the chair must match the rest of your setup. In terms of the tilt on the back of the chair, it’s best to be relatively upright when you can, but feel free to recline the backrest every now and again. As a rule of thumb, you should be as close to your desk as possible, so if you can, push the seat forward so the armrests fit underneath your desk.\n\nThen, if it isn’t already, ensure your computer screen is on a level with your eye line. Preferably, you should be looking 2-3in below the casing on the top of the screen – you don’t want to be tilting your head up or down for long periods.\n\nFinally, remember to get up and move around at least once every half hour. Long periods of sitting are a stressor for the muscles and discs in your back, so it’s good to switch up your posture every now and again. By leaving your desk, you’re less likely to forget about maintaining your posture throughout the day – anything to avoid the dreaded slouch.\n\nHow to clean an ergonomic chair\n\nMost ergonomic office chairs are constructed from a range of materials – from chrome and nylon to faux leather – that all require a different approach when it comes to keeping them spick and span.\n\nFor chrome and plastic components, such as arm rests, you can simply wipe them clean – dampen a cloth with a mix of water and mild dish soap to tackle any stubborn marks, and be sure to dry the areas thoroughly afterwards.\n\nWhen it comes to fabric components, it’s best to avoid liquid cleaning solutions, if possible. Use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum cleaner to get rid of any dust or crumbs that have accumulated on the seat and backrest of your chair. If you happen to spill your coffee (or any other fluid) on the fabric of your ergonomic chair, soak up as much of the liquid as possible and use a suitable fabric cleaner to spot clean any remaining stains – it’s a good idea to test cleaning solutions on a small, inconspicuous area, to make sure the product won’t discolour the fabric of your chair.\n\nFor more ways to make working from home more comfortable, read our round-up of the best laptop stands",

Read our Privacy notice\n\nAs Bjorn Borg observed stoically from the Royal Box, Carlos Alcaraz moved to within a match of emulating the great Swede. The 22-year-old, tennis’s hottest property, who is in the form of his life and is on a 24-match winning streak dating back to April, is chasing the “double double”: winning both Roland Garros and Wimbledon in successive years.\n\nBorg did it three times, in fact, from 1978-1980, but it's something Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer all missed out on. Yet just three years since he burst onto the world scene in 2022, Alcaraz is on the cusp of a sensational feat. And despite flirting with a final-set decider in the semi-finals here against the world No 5 Taylor Fritz, it felt somewhat inevitable that Alcaraz would hit his superlative heights when it mattered most.\n\nDown 6-4 in the fourth-set tie-break, Alcaraz sprinkled his typical dose of Centre Court magic to win four points in a row and take victory over the American: 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6). And given his bamboozling shot selection and poise beyond his years, he was fooling nobody with his humble post-match sentiments.\n\nopen image in gallery Carlos Alcaraz roared into his third Wimbledon final ( Getty )\n\n“It was a really difficult match, it always is when I play against Taylor,” he said on court afterwards. “Playing the semi-finals here is not easy with the nerves and the pressure.\n\n“I’m just very proud of the way I stayed calm and thought clearly. This is my dream, stepping onto these courts, at the most beautiful tournaments in the world.”\n\nAlcaraz is not one to arrogantly overlook any challenge before him, and he did not do so here. Fritz, competing in his first Wimbledon semi-final but also riding a wave having won two grass court tournaments in Stuttgart and Eastbourne, started out on serve like a man oddly dazed by the occasion. The American was not at the races for all of four minutes at the start of the match. His sloppy start cost him the first set.\n\nBroken immediately, with Alcaraz the beneficiary of a dead net cord mid-rally (as if the Spaniard needs luck on his side), Fritz was thrown straight into the eye of the storm in the first hour, with Alcaraz playing some breathtaking stuff. Frighteningly ruthless on serve, losing just four points behind it in the first set and zero after finding his first serve, and zealously inspired on return.\n\nOne point summed it all up as Fritz dived in vain at the net, reaching for a pinpoint Alcaraz pass like a goalkeeper grasping at thin air for the ball, when the whole stadium knows it’s heading for the bottom corner. Alcaraz could not help but smirk, briefly. He’d go on to serve out the set to love and put himself well on the way to Sunday’s showpiece.\n\nIt was no secret that if Alcaraz was, miraculously, able to maintain his stunningly high level for the rest of the match, Fritz had little to no hope. But gradually, the 27-year-old doggedly fought his way back into the contest, taking the ball early and flat to great effect. By the end of the second, it was Alcaraz’s serve which was vulnerable, particularly during a stop-start game during which two spectators fainted in the stands amid 31C temperatures. Alcaraz saved a break point, but the momentum had shifted.\n\nopen image in gallery Alcaraz looks on after Taylor Fritz’s dive at the net ( Getty )\n\nCritically, Fritz did not melt in the SW19 sunshine at the critical juncture, with a tie-break appearing to beckon in the second. However, at 6-5 on serve, a momentary lapse in concentration and execution from Alcaraz presented three set points to the American; the Spaniard went long on the forehand and, much like Fritz in the opener, was punished for his erratic few minutes.\n\nCuriously, having taken his first set against Alcaraz in six attempts, Fritz chose this moment to take a 10-minute bathroom break. An interesting call, given the tide of the match was with him.\n\nAlcaraz, unperturbed and waiting patiently at the back of the court, regrouped and came out of the blocks with an extra spring. Cranking into gear, Alcaraz roared to his player box as he broke to love early in the third set, running the 6ft 4in Fritz ragged with a drop-shot and then a lob.\n\nopen image in gallery Fritz could not force a fifth set ( PA )\n\nopen image in gallery Alcaraz is through to another Wimbledon final ( PA )\n\nBy the time Fritz surrendered the set on his own serve with a backhand long, we had barely played two hours, with both racing through their service games – bar the odd exception.\n\nThe fourth set followed a similar trajectory to the second, nip and tuck throughout and both men serving supremely. Yet the edgier of the two was Fritz, with a few gesticulations to his box in moments of frustration. But a tiebreak, which felt a formality in the second, came to fruition in the fourth.\n\nRather inevitably, Alcaraz reached new heights in the breaker, just when it mattered most. Fritz, with some terrific play of his own, found himself a point away from forcing a fifth set at 6-4 before Alcaraz, somehow and someway, turned defence into attack in the blink of an eye. The Spaniard won four points in a row, unbreakable at the back of the court and exquisitely delicate at the net, to emerge victorious. He leant back and roared.\n\n“Right now, I don’t want to think about Sunday,” he said. “I just want to enjoy this moment.” One of his biggest rivals, Jannik Sinner, awaits, having beaten Novak Djokovic in the other semi-final, which Alcaraz admitted he would watch. “This is one of the most exciting matches on tour,” he said. “Let’s see who I’ll play.”",

Read our Privacy notice\n\nA Virginia judge has ordered prosecutors to give the defense documentation about the reassignment of a digital forensic examiner who had been working on the case in which a man is accused of plotting with an au pair to kill his wife and another man.\n\nFairfax Circuit Court Chief Judge Penney Azcarate on Thursday ordered Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric Clingan to collect and distribute any documentation of the assignment change to the defense for Brendan Banfield.\n\nBanfield is charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 deaths of his wife, Christine Banfield, and Joe Ryan.\n\nThe defense had also sought information on the transfer of the lead detective on the case. But the judge declined.\n\nAn attorney for Brendan Banfield alleged in court this week that Fairfax County police commanders had reassigned the two employees who disagreed with the top brass’ analysis of the evidence, particularly a premise that the case involved the husband catfishing one of the victims.\n\n“It is a theory in search of facts rather than a series of facts supporting a theory,” John Carroll, Banfield’s attorney, said in court Thursday.\n\nIn court, prosecutors argued officials had given over all the documentation they had in the case to the defense, objecting to notions that personnel transfers were part of criminal case evidence.\n\nBrendan Miller, a digital forensic examiner with the Fairfax County Police Department, testified Thursday that he analyzed dozens of devices and concluded Christine Banfield had connected with Ryan through a social networking platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. Miller’s analysis found that the two also chatted through Telegram, an encrypted messaging app. Ryan agreed to come to the house for what appeared to be a consensual sexual encounter.\n\nBut Miller’s findings diverged from a theory held by other officials in the department that the messages Ryan was receiving were actually from Brendan Banfield posing as his wife in a ruse to lure Ryan to the Banfields’ home as a scapegoat in a double-killing scheme.\n\nDeputy Chief Patrick Brusch, who oversaw the department’s major crimes bureau at the time, confirmed in testimony that he said Miller would “never be doing another digital forensics case in your major crimes bureau” after he analyzed the evidence.\n\nMiller was transferred out of the department’s digital forensics unit in late 2024, though Brusch testified the reassignment was not punitive or disciplinary. The University of Alabama’s police department peer reviewed and affirmed Miller’s digital forensic findings, according to evidence submitted to the court by Carroll.\n\nIn October 2023, the family's au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. She later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in what prosecutors described as a scheme to frame Ryan, a Fairfax County native, in the stabbing of Christine Banfield, a pediatric intensive care nurse.\n\nThe au pair, who authorities said had a romantic affair with Brendan Banfield, agreed to cooperate with officials in their case against him. Brendan Banfield was arrested nearly a year after Magalhães. In a proffer, the au pair backed officials’ belief that the husband was behind the online account in a plot to kill his wife and stage it to look like he and the au pair shot a predator in defense.\n\nOn Thursday, Clingan acknowledged there were multiple case theories among officials, but Magalhães’ account narrowed them down to one.\n\n“With 12 different homicide detectives, there were 24 different theories,” Clingan said. “Now, one theory.”\n\nKyle Bryant, who was the lead detective on the case and was moved off the homicide team earlier this year, testified he faced mounting pressure from higher-ups at the department to support the catfish theory. Bryant testified he followed what he believed the evidence showed.\n\n“Were you ever confronted by command staff about the theory of the case that you disagreed with?” Carroll asked Bryant.\n\n“Yes,” he testified.\n\nThough Judge Azcarate did not find that prosecutors intentionally withheld information about Miller’s transfer, she ordered Clingan to collect and distribute any documentation of the assignment change to the defense. She did not tell prosecutors to hand over documents on Bryant’s transfer.\n\n“The transfer that gives the court pause is Miller’s because it relates to the theory of this case,” the judge said.\n\nBrendan Banfield’s trial is set for October.",

Therefore, we can say this is a unique tribute to a uniquely wonderful person.\n\n“By retiring this squad number, we are making it eternal – and therefore never to be forgotten. Diogo joined us in 2020, he won us number 20, and he wore – with honour, distinction and affection – the number 20. As far as Liverpool Football Club is concerned, he will be forever our number 20.”\n\nLiverpool have also confirmed that tributes will be paid to Jota and Andre Silva on Sunday before and during the club’s first match since their deaths.\n\nopen image in gallery Jota's No 20 shirt will be retired by the club ( Getty Images )\n\nopen image in gallery Liverpool's captain Virgil van Dijk carried a ‘20’ wreath at Jota’s funeral ( REUTERS )\n\nArne Slot’s side face Championship club Preston North End at Deepdale in their opening pre-season fixture, 10 days after Jota and Silva died in a car accident in Spain.\n\nA minute’s silence will take place, along with a rendition of the Liverpool anthem ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ while Preston captain Ben Whiteman will lay a wreath in front of the visiting fans and both teams will wear black armbands.\n\nThere will also be digital tributes on the big screen and the pitch-side electronic advertising hoardings, while the commemorative edition of the matchday programme will include pieces on both footballers and will be free to supporters with a ticket.\n\nThere are also tributes to Jota, who scored 65 goals in 182 games over a five-year Liverpool career, at Anfield and former captain Steven Gerrard laid flowers on Friday as he paid his respects.\n\nFather of three Jota, who married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso 11 days before the accident, died alongside his brother after a Lamborghini they were travelling in burst into flames following a suspected tyre blowout in the early hours of Thursday, July 3.\n\nReds manager Arne Slot attended last Saturday's funeral, along with club captain Virgil van Dijk and team-mates including Andy Robertson, Conor Bradley, Ryan Gravenberch, Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones, Darwin Nunez and Joe Gomez.",

Appeals Court said that the government “indisputably” had the authority to withdraw the plea deal – which a senior Pentagon official reached with Mohammed last year before former defense secretary Lloyd Austin intervened.\n\nUnder the plea deal, Mohammed and two co-defendants would have pleaded guilty to their roles in the terrorist plot in exchange for life in prison, avoiding the death penalty.\n\nThe agreement stirred controversy with 9/11 victims and the families of victims who wished to see Mohammed face the death penalty for helping orchestrate and carry out the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\nBefore the deal could be finalized, Austin stepped in, saying he should have the final say, and withdrew it.\n\nopen image in gallery A controversial plea deal for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the thought to be mastermind behind 9/11, was struck down on Friday ( AP )\n\nFriday’s ruling from the court means that the decades-long case against Mohammed, 61, will continue remaining in limbo.\n\nIt’s unlikely the ruling will send the case straight to trial at Guantánamo Bay. Mohammed and his co-defendants, Walid bin ‘Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi, can appeal the decision or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nAdditionally, the previous military judge who oversaw the case retired, the New York Times reported. This means a new judge will need to catch up on the substantial number of records in the case.\n\nOne of the reasons for the drawn-out pretrial proceedings is that defense attorneys argued the three co-defendants' 2007 and 2008 confessions were unlawfully obtained through the use of torture. Mohammed alone was waterboarded 183 times and subjected to physical abuse, sleep deprivation, and other “enhanced interrogation techniques” when he was captured in Pakistan in 2003.\n\nFor years, prosecutors and defense attorneys have been going back and forth about whether the use of evidence obtained through torture was admissible in court.\n\nThe delays have concerned some victims and victims families that the case will never go to trial and the men would die in prison without being convicted.\n\nThat may have been one of the motivating factors in the Pentagon official seeking a plea deal with the men.",

Read our Privacy notice\n\nStrap yourselves in, folks. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have endured their fair share of frights over the past 12 days at the All England Club, but the two leading stars in men’s tennis are not to be denied. They have, we have, a thrilling rematch ahead of us on Sunday afternoon, five weeks on from their Roland Garros epic. And with the greatest of respect to Novak Djokovic, a seven-time champion no less, this is the final Wimbledon will have wanted too.\n\nOn Friday, both Alcaraz and Sinner emerged victorious in their semi-finals but it was Sinner – the world No 1, chasing a first Wimbledon title – who made the most emphatic statement. Taking on Djokovic, eyeing a seventh consecutive final here, Sinner walked onto Centre Court and played lights-out tennis. It was the closest thing to flawless we’ve seen all year.\n\nIn less than two hours, Djokovic – albeit a Djokovic hampered by injury – was swatted aside like a rookie on the south-west London stage he has made his own, the scoreline a devastating 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. Demolition job complete.\n\nopen image in gallery Jannik Sinner set up a Wimbledon final with Carlos Alcaraz by swatting Novak Djokovic aside ( Getty )\n\n“Amazing, I cannot believe it,” Sinner said on court. “From my side, I served very well, I felt great on court and was moving much better today. I tried to stay calm and play the best tennis I could, especially in the important moments.”\n\nThere was a sombre tone to the finale, however. Djokovic, clearly hampered by a thigh injury sustained at the end of his quarter-final win against Flavio Cobolli, was virtually on his knees in the third set. Such a rare sight in over 20 years on tour, Djokovic this time could not muster any resistance.\n\nWill we see him here again? He hopes so. “I would be sad, hopefully it’s not my last match on Centre Court,” he said in his post-match press conference, just 20 minutes after his match concluded. “I’m not planning to end my Wimbledon career today. I want to be back here at least once.”\n\nThe Serb acknowledged pre-match, having not claimed a set in their French Open semi-final last month, that it would “take the best of me” to beat Sinner. The Serb, 15 years older we should not forget, and in the autumn of his glittering career, has not beaten Sinner in 30 months.\n\nBut the SW19 grass, without a doubt, represented his best shot at a record-breaking 25th grand slam, having defeated Sinner here in 2023 and 2022.\n\nHowever, the leaps and bounds by which the 23-year-old Italian has improved his game, athleticism and mentality are why he is the top men’s player. Yet he had a point to prove on grass, the only surface he had yet to reach a major final on. And here, Sinner came out of the blocks like Usain Bolt on an August day in Beijing.\n\nopen image in gallery Djokovic waves goodbye to Centre Court after his semi-final exit ( PA )\n\nSinner sealed an early break with a superb lob and, from there, the first set was claimed. A low-energy Djokovic, whose fitness beforehand was in doubt, did not have so much as a sniff on return. Some pill to swallow, you’d assume, for the best returner the sport has ever seen.\n\nIn fact, in mirror image to Alcaraz’s win against Taylor Fritz earlier in the day, Sinner did not lose a point behind his first serve in the opening set. First-set tie-break on Sunday, anyone?\n\nIn the first hour, Sinner was strutting around the court like a mechanical monster, smashing the life out of every shot with supreme accuracy. Yet curiously, for as full throttle as Sinner was, Djokovic was severely lacking in adrenaline, unable to shift out of first gear. Even chants of “Nole, Nole” were futile in the face of Sinner’s unwavering attacking tennis. In hindsight, perhaps deep down, the Serb knew he was fighting a battle he couldn’t possibly win.\n\nDjokovic did have a chance at 4-2 in the second set. The chance was 0-15. Sinner produced three unreturnable first serves, before Djokovic netted. And that was that.\n\nopen image in gallery Sinner was relentless in his semi-final win ( Getty )\n\nThe Serb escaped his own service game but Sinner, unrelenting, powered to the second set. By this point, his first-serve accuracy was riding high at 76 per cent and he’d only lost two of 32 points behind it. That told its own story.\n\nFor Djokovic’s 11-year-old son Stefan in his player box, wearing a cap littered with signatures of top players, including Sinner and Alcaraz, it was a gut-wrenching watch. Djokovic wisely took a medical timeout as the trainer tended to his leg. The writing was on the wall.\n\nBut then, suddenly, Sinner did something unusual: he made a few errors. Even more unusual: they were on serve. Djokovic ground his way to 30-30 and Sinner mishit a routine forehand. Then, the Italian lumped another into the net. A break of serve and a roar from the crowd, keen for more action this Friday night. Was this to be the turning point?\n\nopen image in gallery Djokovic was close to surrender in the third and final set ( Getty )\n\nNot this time. Sinner’s peerless level had dropped, ever so slightly, and Djokovic even had a point to go 4-0 up. But Sinner crucially held, overcame his 10-minute lag, and broke back as Djokovic, almost in surrender, meekly plunged a drop-shot into the net.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come. Djokovic was no longer moving freely as a result of his leg problem, and was failing to chase down every ball in normal fashion. Sinner claimed another break, with Djokovic heading into the net behind every serve, and soon the ending was inevitable. The Serb saved two match points on his own serve, but was a beaten man. He didn’t even run for the final ball, as Sinner comfortably stroked a forehand into the open court.\n\nThe biggest compliment we can pay to Djokovic, a man refusing to retire in the face of Father Time, was his will to compete despite hardship here. He didn’t withdraw pre-match. He didn’t retire. He finished the contest.\n\nAnd the Serb gave the obligatory wave as he left the stage. For the last time? After this, it feels more likely than ever. The next generation is now the present generation and their protagonists will take to the court once more in the showpiece match on Sunday. Popcorn at the ready, everyone.",

      "title": "Culture of the United Kingdom",
      "content": "The culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by its combined nations' history, its interaction with the cultures of Europe, the individual diverse cultures of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the impact of the British Empire. The culture of the United Kingdom may also colloquially be referred to as British culture. Although British culture is a distinct entity, the individual cultures of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are diverse. There have been varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness between these four cultures.British literature is particularly esteemed. The modern novel was developed in Britain, and playwrights, poets, and authors are among its most prominent cultural figures. Britain has also made notable contributions to theatre, music, cinema, art, architecture and television. The UK is also the home of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church in Wales, the state church and mother church of the Anglican Communion, the third-largest Christian denomination. Britain contains some of the world's oldest universities, has made many contributions to philosophy, science, technology and medicine, and is the birthplace of many prominent scientists and inventions. The Industrial Revolution began in the UK and had a profound effect on socio-economic and cultural conditions around the world.\nBritish culture has been influenced by historical and modern migration, the historical invasions of Great Britain, and the British Empire. As a result of the British Empire, significant British influence can be observed in the language, law, culture and institutions of its former colonies, most of which are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. A subset of these states form the Anglosphere, and are among Britain's closest allies. British colonies and dominions influenced British culture in turn, particularly British cuisine.\nSport is an important part of British culture, and numerous sports originated in their organised, modern form in the country including cricket, football, boxing, tennis and rugby. The UK has been described as a \"cultural superpower\", and London has been described as a world cultural capital. A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the UK ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, the culture of Great Britain has primarily consisted of the separate native traditions of England, Scotland and Wales. With regard to cultural influences, prior to the expansion of the British Empire, the island had been most notably influenced by French culture (via the Normans), Scandinavian culture (via the Vikings) and Italian culture (via the Romans).\nThe arrival of Celtic and Germanic tribes influenced Britain's early development. The Celtic peoples introduced unique languages, traditions, and social structures. Subsequently, the migrations of Germanic tribes, such as the Anglo-Saxons, further influenced Britain's cultural landscape. The ancient Roman occupation of Britain, lasting almost 400 years, also impacted the linguistic and cultural identity of Great Britain.\nFollowing the expansion of the British Empire, England, Scotland and Wales absorbed different peoples from around the world, and, post-World War II, Britain developed a more diverse cultural landscape through higher levels of immigration. Furthermore, following the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and EU enlargement in 2004 and 2007, the UK experienced a significant rise in immigration from Eastern Europe. Today, the UK has a sizable immigrant population, and encompasses the cultures of British people from various backgrounds, with South Asian, Continental European, African and Caribbean descent being most prevalent.\n\n\n== Language ==\n\nFirst spoken in early medieval England, the English language is the de facto official language of the UK, and is spoken monolingually by an estimated 95% of the British population. Seven other languages are recognised by the British Government under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages – Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Scots, Cornish, Irish, Ulster Scots, and British Sign Language.\nIn Wales, all pupils at state schools must either be taught through the medium of Welsh or study it as an additional language until age 16, and the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the Welsh and English languages should be treated equally in the public sector, so far as is reasonable and practicable. Irish and Ulster Scots enjoy limited use alongside English in Northern Ireland, mainly in publicly commissioned translations. The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act, passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2005, recognised Gaelic as an official language of Scotland and required the creation of a national plan for Gaelic to provide strategic direction for the development of the Gaelic language. The Cornish language is a revived language that became extinct as a first language in Cornwall in the late 18th century.\n\n\n=== Regional accents ===\nDialects and regional accents vary heavily amongst the four countries of the United Kingdom, as well as within the countries themselves. This is partially the result of the long history of immigration to the UK, for example Northern English dialects contain many words with Old Norse roots. Scottish English, Welsh English, and Hiberno-Irish are varieties of English distinct from both English English and the native languages of those countries. Received Pronunciation is the Standard English accent in England and Wales, while in Scotland Scottish Standard English is a distinct dialect. Although these accents have a high social prestige, since the 1960s a greater permissiveness toward regional English varieties has taken hold in education.\nThe great variety of British accents is often noted, with nearby regions often having highly distinct dialects and accents, for example there are large differences between Scouse and Mancunian despite Liverpool and Manchester being only 35 miles (56 km) apart. Dialectal English is often found in literature, for example Emily Brontë's novel Wuthering Heights contains Yorkshire dialect.\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe United Kingdom inherited the literary traditions of England, Scotland and Wales. These include Arthurian literature and its Welsh origins, Norse-influenced Old English literature, the works of English authors Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare, and Scots works such as John Barbour's The Brus. \n\n\n==== Augustan Age ====\nThe early 18th century period of British literature is known as the Augustan Age and included the development of the novel. Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe  (1719) and Moll Flanders (1722)  are often seen as the first English novels. Alongside these works, poetry also flourished, with notable examples such as The Rape of the Lock (1712) by Alexander Pope, a mock-heroic poem that satirized the social mores of the time. However, the development of the novel took place in a wider literary context that included the rise of prose satires – which reached a high point with Gulliver's Travels  (1729) by Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift, and earlier foreign works like the Spanish Don Quixote. Other novels by Jonathan Swift include  A Tale of a Tub (1704), An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity (1712), and A Modest Proposal (1729). With the publishing of these books, he gained literary fame and formed lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot, who, with Swift, created the Martinus Scriblerus Club in 1713. Other novels made at this time are: Tom Jones (1749), by Henry Fielding; Pamela (1740) and Clarissa (1748), by Samuel Richardson; Laurence Sterne – The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759–1767). Pamela is hailed as one of the first true novels in English literature while Clarissa is regarded as Richardson's magnum opus and one of the greatest novels in the English language. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman is an experimental novel.\nAlso linked to the Augustan period is Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language. Published in 1755, it was viewed as the pre-eminent British Dictionary until the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary 150 years later. Each word defined in detail, with descriptions of their various uses and numerous literary quotes as illustrations. This was the first dictionary of its kind, containing 40,000 words and nearly 114,000 quotes packed together with Johnson's personal touch. It is among the most influential dictionaries, or among most authoritative, in the history of the English language and considered to be a monumental achievement in lexicography. A group of London booksellers contracted Johnson to write a dictionary for the sum of 1,500 guineas (£1,575), equivalent to about £310,000 in 2025. Johnson took seven years to complete the work, although he had claimed he could finish it in three. A warm reception greeted Johnson's Dictionary as it was the first dictionary that could be read with pleasure. The definitions full of wit and depth of thought supported by passages from beloved poets and philosophers, meant a reader could be content spending an evening poring over its pages. Johnson's choice of structure and format has certainly shaped future English dictionaries and lexicons and the role they play in language development.\nRichard Steele, another famous author known for comedies and pamphlets during the Augustan Period, began his literary career with \"The Christian Hero\" (1701), a moral pamphlet that was criticized due to his personal lifestyle, followed by the successful comedy The Funeral later that year. In 1703, he wrote The Lying Lover, an early sentimental comedy that failed on stage. In 1705, he collaborated with Joseph Addison on The Tender Husband and contributed the prologue to John Vanbrugh's The Mistake. Steele's major breakthrough came in 1709 with the creation of The Tatler, a tri-weekly periodical in which he wrote the majority of the essays under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff, aiming to expose societal vices and promote simplicity. Despite its success, The Tatler was shut down in 1711 due to political pressure, prompting Steele and Addison to co-found The Spectator in 1711 and The Guardian in 1713, solidifying Steele's role as a leading figure in early British journalism.\n\n\n==== Romantic Period ====\nThe Romantic Period was marked by a revival of poetry and a focus on emotion, nature, and individualism, responding to the growing rationalism of the Enlightenment. This era gave rise to many literary works that explored the tension between reason and imagination. William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads (1798)  is considered a landmark collection, emphasizing the beauty of nature and the primacy of emotion, and marking the official start of the Romantic Movement. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818), one of the earliest science fiction novels, delves into themes of creation, responsibility, and the consequences of unchecked scientific ambition, framed within Gothic conventions. Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1813) offered a brilliant social satire, critiquing class structures and the courtship rituals of Regency England, and remains one of the most beloved novels in British Literature. Lord Byron's Don Juan (1819–1824) is a satirical epic poem that details the adventures of the legendary lover, displaying Byron's wit, irony, and irreverence toward societal norms.\nSir Walter Scott's Waverley (1814), widely considered the first historical novel, vividly recreates the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, cementing Scott's place as a major figure in British literature. William Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794) blends art and poetry to explore themes of innocence, experience, and societal corruption, providing a unique vision of the Romantic spirit. Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound (1820), a lyrical drama, explores themes of rebellion, tyranny, and human freedom, standing as one of his most radical and imaginative works. Robert Burns, the famed Scottish poet, revived interest in Scots literature with works such as Auld Lang Syne, which celebrated the vernacular tradition. Lastly, Mary Wollstonecraft's \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792) stands as one of the earliest and most influential works of feminist philosophy, advocating for women's education and equal rights in a male-dominated society.\nAlthough primarily associated with the Victorian Era, Lewis Carroll's Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) emerged from the later part of this broader Romantic tradition, blending imaginative fantasy with playful wordplay. This whimsical novel follows young Alice's journey through a dreamlike world populated by peculiar characters, exploring themes of logic, absurdity, and identity. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland remains a pioneering work of literary nonsense, captivating readers with its inventive narrative and surreal exploration of the boundaries between reality and imagination.\n\n\n==== Victorian Era ====\nThe late Georgian Era and Victorian era saw a renewed focus on the novel. A key theme of these novels was social commentary. Early in the period Jane Austen satirised the lifestyle of the gentry and nobility, while the later novels of Charles Dickens often used humour and keen observations to criticise poverty and social stratification. One of his novels, Oliver Twist, describes Victorian Times and the sordid lives of criminals and exposes the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London. Another novel by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations (1861), is a bildungsroman that follows the life of Pip, an orphan navigating ambition, love, and personal growth while critiquing social mobility and class divisions. Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847) blends Gothic romance with social commentary, focusing on a young woman's quest for independence against the rigid structures of Victorian society. The three Brontë sisters and George Eliot commented on Northern England and the Midlands respectively, though all four women wrote under male pen names during their lifetimes, partly to deflect anti-feminist criticism. Nevertheless, openly female authors achieved considerable success in the period, such as the predominantly religious poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Christina Rossetti. George Eliot's Middlemarch (1871–1872), often regarded as one of the greatest English novels, explores themes of politics, marriage, and ambition in the setting of a provincial English town.\nElizabeth Gaskell's North and South (1854–1855) contrasts the industrial north with the agricultural south, addressing issues such as class conflict, industrialization, and gender roles. Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1891) offers a tragic critique of Victorian society's treatment of women, sexuality, and class, while Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) examines themes of aestheticism, morality, and vanity in a Gothic narrative where the protagonist's portrait ages as his soul corrupts. In Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), the novella delves into themes of duality, identity, and morality through the split personality of its protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892), a group of short stories, which popularised the detective genre and introduced one of literature's most iconic characters: Sherlock Holmes.\nRudyard Kipling's literature exemplifies the British Empire's influence on British literature through his works that often reflect the ethos of imperialism and colonialism. His novels The Jungle Book, which is considered to be classic piece of literature, and The Man Who Would Be King are both set in British India, showcasing the cultural and political impact of British rule in the region. His poem If— famously captures the concept of the \"stiff upper lip,\" a British ideal of stoicism and self-discipline. Additionally, The White Man’s Burden conveys a white supremacist and imperialist perspective, encouraging the colonial domination of non-European peoples under the guise of a civilizing mission. Kipling's works, while celebrated for their literary qualities, remain controversial for their imperialist themes.\n\n\n==== World War and Modern Literature ====\nWorld War I gave rise to British war poets and writers such as Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, and Rupert Brooke, who wrote (often paradoxically) of their expectations of war, and their experiences in the trenches. Initially idealistic and patriotic in tone, as the war progressed the tone of the movement became increasingly sombre and pacifistic. The beginning of the twentieth century also saw the Celtic Revival stimulate a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature, while the Scottish Renaissance brought modernism to Scottish literature as well as an interest in new forms in the literatures of Scottish Gaelic and Scots. The English novel developed in the 20th century into much greater variety and it remains today the dominant English literary form.\nThe contemporary British literary scene is marked by awards such as the Booker Prize, created in 1969, and festivals including the Welsh Hay Festival, held since 1988. The prominent status of children's literature in the UK was demonstrated in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, which contained sequence dedicated to prominent children's literary characters. In 2003 the BBC carried out a British survey entitled The Big Read in order to find the \"nation's best-loved novel\", with works by English novelists J. R. R. Tolkien, Jane Austen, Philip Pullman, Douglas Adams and J. K. Rowling making up the top five on the list. More than 75% of the British public read at least one book annually. The UK is also among the largest publishers of books. As of 2017, six firms in the United Kingdom rank among the world's biggest publishers of books in terms of revenue: Bloomsbury, Cambridge University Press, Informa, Oxford University Press, Pearson, and RELX Group.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nFrom its formation in 1707 the United Kingdom has had a vibrant tradition of theatre, much of it inherited from England, Scotland and Wales. The Union of the Crowns coincided with the decline of highbrow and provocative Restoration comedy in favour of sentimental comedy, domestic tragedy such as George Lillo's The London Merchant (1731), and by an overwhelming interest in Italian opera. Popular entertainment became more important in this period than ever before, with fair-booth burlesque and mixed forms that are the ancestors of the English music hall. These forms flourished at the expense of other forms of English drama, which went into a long period of decline. In Scotland the opposite occurred, with the emergence of specifically Scottish plays including John Home's Douglas and the works of Walter Scott, which included original plays as well as adaptations of his Waverley novels.\nThe late 19th century saw revival of English theatre with arrival of Irishmen George Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde, who influenced domestic English drama and revitalised it. Their contemporaries Gilbert and Sullivan had a similar impact on musical theatre with their comic operas. The Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was opened in Shakespeare's birthplace Stratford upon Avon in 1879 and Herbert Beerbohm Tree founded an Academy of Dramatic Art at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1904.\nThe early twentieth century was dominated by drawing-room plays produced by the likes of Noël Coward, which were then challenged by the kitchen sink realism and absurdist drama influenced by Irishman Samuel Beckett in the 1950s and 60s. Conversely 1952 saw the first performance of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, a drawing-room murder mystery that has seen over 25,000 performances and is the longest-running West End show. At the same time the performing arts theatre Sadler's Wells, under Lilian Baylis, nurtured talent that led to the development of an opera company, which became the English National Opera (ENO); a theatre company, which evolved into the National Theatre; and a ballet company, which eventually became the English Royal Ballet. Elsewhere the Royal Shakespeare Company was founded in 1959 at Stratford-upon-Avon, and continues to mainly stage Shakespeare's plays.\nContemporary British theatre is focused on the West End, London's major theatre district. The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the City of Westminster dates back to 1663, making it the oldest London theatre, however the Theatre Royal at the Bristol Old Vic is the oldest continually-operating theatre in the English speaking world, opening in 1768. The musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber have dominated the West End since the late 20th century, leading him to be dubbed \"the most commercially successful composer in history\". A National Theatre of Scotland was set up in 2006.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\n\n==== Classical music ====\n\nBritish Baroque music was heavily influenced by continental fashions. This is exemplified by George Frideric Handel, a German-born naturalised British citizen whose choral music set British taste for the next two centuries. His operas also helped Britain challenge Italy as a centre of operatic production. Classical music attracted much attention from 1784 with the formation of the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival, which was the longest running classical music festival of its kind until the final concerts in 1912. Beyond this, the establishment of the London Philharmonic Society in 1813, Royal Academy of Music in 1822, and Irish Academy of Music in 1848 aided the professionalisation of British classical music and patronage of composers.\nThe Philharmonic Society was a strong supporter of the German Felix Mendelssohn, an early Romantic composer who also strongly influenced British music. In Ireland, John Field invented the nocturne and may have been an influence on Chopin and Liszt. A notable development of the mid- to late-nineteenth century was the resurgence of English-language opera and the establishment of several prominent orchestras, including the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic in 1840, Manchester-based Hallé in 1858, the Scottish Orchestra in 1891 and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1920. The most notable trend in classical music at the turn of the century was the nationalistic trend that developed. This was initially seen in works like The Masque at Kenilworth, which reconstructed an Elizabethan masque, but later took a pastoral turn under the influence of the British folk revival. Examplars of this period are Ralph Vaughan Williams' English Folk Song Suite, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's Scottish Rhapsodies.\nModern and contemporary classical music takes a variety of forms. Composers such as Benjamin Britten developed idiosyncratic and avant-garde styles, while the likes of William Walton produced more conventional ceremonial and patriotic music. The UK now has several major orchestras, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and the Philharmonia, while the establishment of the Opera North in 1977 sought to redress the balance of operatic institutions away from London. There are several classical festivals, such as Aldeburgh and Glydebourne, while the BBC Proms are an important annual fixture in the classical calendar.\n\n\n==== Popular music ====\n\nPopular commercial music in Britain can be traced back at least as far as the seventeenth-century broadside ballad, and also encompasses brass band music and music hall. Popular music in the modern sense began to emerge in the 1950s, as the American styles of jazz and rock and roll became popular. The skiffle revival was an early attempt to create a British form of American music, but it was the emergence of British rock and roll by the early 1960s that established a viable British popular music industry. Genres such as beat and British blues were re-exported to America by bands such as the Beatles and Rolling Stones, in a move that came to be called the British Invasion. The 1960s saw the development of heavy metal in Birmingham and the wider area. The development of blues rock helped differentiate rock and pop music, leading to the emergence of several sub-genres of rock in the 1970s. Glam rock was a particularly British genre that emphasised outrageous costumes, while the end of the decade saw the rise of punk, new wave, and post-punk bands. The influence of immigration could also be seen in the increased prominence of World music, particularly Jamaican music.\nThe 1980s were a successful decade in British pop, as a second British Invasion was witnessed and new technology enabled genres such as synthpop to form. Jazz saw a resurgence as black British musicians created new fusions such as Acid Jazz. Indie rock was a reaction to the perceived saturation of the music industry by pop, exemplified by Stock Aitken Waterman's domination of the charts. This continued in the 1990s, as boy bands, all-female and mixed groups dominated the singles chart, while the Madchester scene helped drive alternative rock and Britpop to the mainstream. British soul saw a rise that continued into the 2000s, including the global success of Adele. Dance music also saw innovation, with genres such as dubstep and new rave emerging.\n\n\n==== Folk and sub-national music ====\n\nIn contrast to the comparatively homogeneous classical and pop genres, each nation of the UK has retained a distinct tradition of folk music. The traditional folk music of England has contributed to several genres, such as sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music. It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities, while musical Morris dancing is an English folk dance known to have existed at least as early as the mid-15th century.\nThe bagpipes have long been a national symbol of Scotland, and the Great Highland Bagpipe is widely recognised. The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, are ballads of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century, demonstrating great regional variety, particularly local traditions such as the Border ballads, which include the particularly influential Ballad of Chevy Chase. British folk groups, such as Fairport Convention, have drawn heavily from these ballads.\nSimilarly, while the national anthem \"God Save the King\" and other patriotic songs such as \"Rule, Britannia!\" represent the United Kingdom, each of the four individual countries of the UK has its own patriotic hymns. For example, Jerusalem, Flower of Scotland, Land of My Fathers, and Danny Boy pertain exclusively to England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland respectively. These songs are often used at sporting events where each nation competes individually. \n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nBritain has had a significant film industry for over a century. While many films focus on British culture, British cinema is also marked by its interaction and competition with American and continental European cinema.\nThe UK was the location of the oldest surviving moving picture, Roundhay Garden Scene (1888), which was shot in Roundhay, Leeds by French inventor Louis Le Prince, while the first British film, Incident at Clovelly Cottage was shot in 1895. The world's first colour motion picture was shot by Edward Raymond Turner in 1902. British film production suffered in the 1920s in face of competition from American imports and a legal requirement for cinemas to show a set quota of British films, which encouraged poor-quality, low-cost productions to meet this demand. This had changed by the 1940s, when the government encouraged fewer, higher-quality films to be made. This era also saw the rise of Alfred Hitchcock, who soon moved to the US and become one of the twentieth century's most influential directors. During World War II the Crown Film Unit established a reputation for documentaries, while Powell and Pressburger began their influential and innovative collaboration.\nThe post-war period was a particular high point for British filmmaking, producing The Third Man and Brief Encounter, which the British Film Institute consider the best and second-best British films respectively. Laurence Olivier's 1948 Hamlet was the first British film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1950s saw a focus on popular domestic topics such as comedies, including the enduring Carry On series, and World War II epics such as The Dam Busters. At the end of the decade Hammer Films took advantage of relaxed censorship laws to begin their series of successful horror films. The beginning of the 1960s saw the British New Wave style develop, influenced by its French counterpart, that sought to depict a wider strata of society in a realistic manner. The 1960s also saw renewed American financial interest in British film, which particularly manifested itself in the development of historical epics, such as Best Picture winners Lawrence of Arabia and A Man for All Seasons; spy thrillers, including the first films in the James Bond franchise; and films based on 'swinging London' scene.\nThe 1970s saw a withdrawal of American support and a retrenchment in British cinema, though the decade did see culturally important productions such as the horror The Wicker Man and Monty Python's comedic films. The decade also saw the Commonwealth influence British film, as Pressure and A Private Enterprise are considered the first Black British and British Asian films respectively. 1981's Chariots of Fire and 1982's Gandhi both won the Best Picture Oscar, the latter winning eight awards, prompting a resurgence in period films. 1982 also saw the creation of Channel 4, which had a remit to promote films for minority audiences. Films with racial and LGBT themes were produced, while Channel 4's involvement saw television stars move into feature films.\nAmerican investment again increased in the 1990s, and the success of Four Weddings and a Funeral saw romantic comedies rise in popularity. Merchant Ivory Productions, boosted by the Oscars success of the previous decade's period pieces, continued to produce films in the same vein. American studios also began to base the production of Hollywood films in the UK, encouraged by tax incentives. 1996's Trainspotting led to increased interest in regional, particularly Scottish, cinema. While American-funded films continued their influence in the 2010s, domestic European co-productions also received acclaim. The Queen was British-French production for which Helen Mirren won Best Actress, while the UK Film Council funded The King's Speech, which won Best Picture in 2011. Asian British cinema has risen in prominence since 1999, when East is East was a mainstream success on a low budget.\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nThe UK has been at the forefront of developments in film, radio and television. Broadcasting in the UK has historically been dominated by the taxpayer-funded but independently run British Broadcasting Corporation (commonly known as the BBC), although other independent radio and television (ITV, Channel 4, Five) and satellite broadcasters (especially BSkyB which has over 10 million subscribers) have become more important in recent years. BBC television, and the other three main television channels are public service broadcasters who, as part of their licence allowing them to operate, broadcast a variety of minority interest programming. The BBC and Channel 4 are state-owned, though they operate independently.\n\nLaunched in 1955, ITV is the oldest commercial television network in the UK. Director Ridley Scott's evocative 1973 Hovis bread television commercial captured the public imagination. Filmed on Gold Hill, Shaftesbury in Dorset, Scott's advert was voted the UK's favourite television advertisement of all time in 2006. Other notable British commercials include the 1989 British Airways face advertisement, the 2005 noitulovE advert for Guinness, the 2007 Gorilla advertisement by Cadbury chocolate featuring a gorilla playing drums with Phil Collins' track \"In the Air Tonight\" playing in the background, and a 2013 advert for Galaxy chocolate bar featuring a computer-generated image of Audrey Hepburn. Christmas commercials are screened from early November in the UK, with campaigns including the John Lewis Christmas advert for the department store chain.\nInternational football tournaments, such as the World Cup, are historically the most viewed sports events among the public, while Match of the Day is the most popular weekly football show. The 1966 FIFA World Cup final and the funeral of Princess Diana are the two most watched television events ever in the UK. Satire has been a prominent feature in British comedy for centuries. The British satire boom of the 1960s, which consisted of writers and performers such as Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, David Frost and Jonathan Miller, has heavily influenced British television, including the sketch comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus created in 1969 by Monty Python. Regarded as the leading figure of the satire boom, Peter Cook was ranked number one in the Comedians' Comedian poll. The puppet show Spitting Image was a satire of the royal family, politics, entertainment, sport and British culture of the 1980s up to the mid-1990s.\n\nHave I Got News for You and Mock the Week are the two longest running satirical panel shows. Satire also features heavily in the Grand Theft Auto video game series which has been ranked among Britain's most successful exports. The slapstick and double entendre of Benny Hill also achieved very high ratings on British television, as did the physical humour of Mr. Bean. Popular comedy duos in television include The Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise, with both shows featuring memorable sketches. Jeeves and Wooster starred Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, an airy, nonchalant, gormless, idle young gentleman and Stephen Fry as Jeeves, his calm, well-informed, and talented valet. Created by and starring Rik Mayall as Richie and Adrian Edmondson as Eddie, Bottom features two crude, perverted flatmates with no jobs and little money, which is noted for its chaotic, nihilistic humour and violent comedy slapstick. Steve Coogan created the character Alan Partridge, a tactless and inept television presenter who often insults his guests and whose inflated sense of celebrity drives him to shameless self-promotion. Da Ali G Show starred Sacha Baron Cohen as a faux-streetwise poseur Ali G from west London, who would conduct real interviews with unsuspecting people, many of whom are celebrities, during which they are asked absurd and ridiculous questions.\nAnimator Nick Park created the Wallace and Gromit characters at Aardman Animations studio in Bristol. They feature in A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995), which all have 100% positive ratings on the aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, while A Matter of Loaf and Death was the most watched television programme in the UK in 2008. Aardman also produce the kid's show Shaun the Sheep. One of the most popular children's shows originating in the UK is Thomas & Friends (based on The Railway Series books by Wilbert Awdry), which has become the number one licensed preschool property in the world. Other popular children's shows include Postman Pat, Fireman Sam, Teletubbies, Bob the Builder and Peppa Pig.\nFirst airing in 1958, Blue Peter is famous for its arts and crafts \"makes\". The show has been a staple for generations of British children. Popular live action TV shows include The Borrowers (based on Mary Norton books on little people), The Adventures of Black Beauty, The Famous Five (based on Enid Blyton books), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (based on the C. S. Lewis novel), and Pride and Prejudice (starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy). The actor David Jason has voiced a number of popular characters in children's animation, including The Wind in the Willows (based on the children's book by Kenneth Grahame), Danger Mouse and Count Duckula. Other children's shows include Where's Wally? (a series based on books by author Martin Handford where readers are challenged to find Wally who is hidden in the group), Dennis the Menace and Gnasher, while Thunderbirds and Terrahawks by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson have been praised for creating Supermarionation.\nDebuting in 1982, The Snowman (featuring the festive song \"Walking in the Air\") is annually screened at Christmas. Shown on the BBC, the UK holds two high-profile charity telethon events, Children in Need, held annually in November, and Comic Relief, which alternates with Sports Relief, every March. The 2011 edition of Comic Relief saw the first appearance of James Corden's Carpool Karaoke sketch when he drove around London singing songs with George Michael. British programmes dominate the list of TV's most watched shows in the UK, with the kitchen sink dramas, ITV's Coronation Street and BBC's EastEnders, both often ranking high on the ratings list compiled by BARB. \nThe major soap operas each feature a pub, and these pubs have become household names throughout the UK. The Rovers Return is the pub in Coronation Street, the Queen Vic (short for the Queen Victoria) is the pub in EastEnders, and the Woolpack in ITV's Emmerdale. The pub being a prominent setting in the three major television soap operas reflects the role pubs have as the focal point of the community in many towns and villages across the UK. Espionage and detective shows have long been a staple of British television, such as the 1960s series The Avengers featuring lady spy adventurer and cultural (and feminist) icon Emma Peel.\nThe United Kingdom has a large number of national and local radio stations which cover a great variety of programming. The most listened to stations are the five main national BBC Radio stations. BBC Radio 1, a new music station aimed at the 16–24 age group. BBC Radio 2, a varied popular music and chat station aimed at adults is consistently highest in the ratings. BBC Radio 4, a varied talk station, is noted for its news, current affairs, drama and comedy output as well as The Archers, its long running soap opera, and other unique programmes, including Desert Island Discs (1942–present), an interview programme in which a famous guest (called a \"castaway\") chooses eight pieces of music, a book and a luxury item that they would take with them to a desert island. Currently presented by Lauren Laverne, it is the longest running music radio programme in British history.\nThe idea for a Christmas message was conceived by one of the founders of the BBC. Delivered annually by the monarch, it was first broadcast on BBC Radio in 1932. An alternative Christmas message was first broadcast on Channel 4 in 1993. Broadcast from 1951 to 1960, radio comedy The Goon Show, starring Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. The show has exerted considerable influence on British comedy and culture. As a film star Sellers in particular became influential to film actors by using different accents and guises and assuming multiple roles in the same film. Comedian Marty Feldman co-created the acclaimed BBC Radio comedy programme Round the Horne in 1965. The long running radio comedy Just a Minute first aired on BBC Radio 4 in 1967. Panellists must talk for sixty seconds on a given subject, \"without hesitation, repetition or deviation\". Guests over the years have included Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard and Sue Perkins. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, the science fiction comedy radio series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was innovative in its use of music and sound effects. The BBC, as a public service broadcaster, also runs minority stations such as BBC Asian Network, BBC Radio 1Xtra and BBC Radio 6 Music, and local stations throughout the country. Rock music station Absolute Radio, and sports station Talksport, are among the biggest commercial radio stations in the UK.\n\nList of radio stations in the United Kingdom\nList of television stations in the United Kingdom\n\n\n=== Print ===\n\nFreedom of the press was established in Great Britain in 1695. Popular national newspapers include The Times, Financial Times, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent.\nFounded by publisher John Walter in 1785, The Times is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, and is the originator of the widely used Times Roman typeface, created by Victor Lardent and commissioned by Stanley Morison in 1931. Newspaper and publishing magnate Alfred Harmsworth played a major role in \"shaping the modern press\" – Harmsworth introduced or harnessed \"broad contents, exploitation of advertising revenue to subsidize prices, aggressive marketing, subordinate regional markets, independence from party control\" – and was called \"the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street.\" The Economist was founded by James Wilson in 1843, and the daily Financial Times was founded in 1888. Founding The Gentleman's Magazine in 1731, Edward Cave coined the term \"magazine\" for a periodical, and was the first publisher to successfully fashion a wide-ranging publication. Founded by Thomas Gibson Bowles, Vanity Fair featured caricatures of famous people for which it is best known today.\nA pioneer of children's publishing, John Newbery made children's literature a sustainable and profitable part of the literary market. The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes was published by Newbery in 1765. Founded by Sir Allen Lane in 1935, Penguin Books revolutionised publishing in the 1930s through its inexpensive paperbacks, bringing high-quality paperback fiction and non-fiction to the mass market. Formed in 1940, Puffin Books is the children's imprint of Penguin Books. Barbara Euphan Todd's scarecrow story, Worzel Gummidge, was the first Puffin story book in 1941.\nThe Guinness Book of Records was the brainchild of Sir Hugh Beaver. On 10 November 1951 he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, and realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated throughout the world, but there was no book with which to settle arguments about records. He realised that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. His idea became reality when an acquaintance of his recommended University friends Norris and Ross McWhirter who were then commissioned to compile what became The Guinness Book of Records in August 1954. E. L. James' erotic romance trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed, have sold over 125 million copies globally, and set the record in the United Kingdom as the fastest selling paperback.\nCopyright laws originated in Britain with the Statute of Anne (also known as the Copyright Act 1709), which outlined the individual rights of the artist. A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognised a right to control the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. The Statute of Anne gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nFrom the creation of the United Kingdom, the English school of painting is mainly notable for portraits and landscapes, and indeed portraits in landscapes. Among the artists of this period are Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), George Stubbs (1724–1806), and Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788).\nPictorial satirist William Hogarth pioneered Western sequential art, and political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\". Following the work of Hogarth, political cartoons developed in England in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of James Gillray. Regarded as being one of the two most influential cartoonists (the other being Hogarth), Gillray has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon, with his satirical work calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals to account.\nThe late 18th century and the early 19th century was perhaps the most radical period in British art, producing William Blake (1757–1827), John Constable (1776–1837) and J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), three of the most influential British artists, each of whom have dedicated spaces allocated for their work at the Tate Britain. Named after Turner, the Turner Prize (created in 1984) is an annual award presented to a British visual artist under the age of 50.\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB) achieved considerable influence after its foundation in 1848 with paintings that concentrated on religious, literary, and genre subjects executed in a colourful and minutely detailed style. PRB artists included John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and subsequently Edward Burne-Jones. Also associated with it was the designer William Morris, whose efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs to some extent defining the Victorian aesthetic and instigating the Arts and Crafts movement.\nVisual artists from the UK in the 20th century include Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, and the pop artists Richard Hamilton and Peter Blake. Also prominent amongst 20th-century artists was Henry Moore, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. Sir Jacob Epstein was a pioneer of modern sculpture. In 1958 artist Gerald Holtom designed the protest logo for the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), the peace movement in the UK, which became a universal peace symbol. As a reaction to abstract expressionism, pop art emerged in England at the end of the 1950s. The 1990s saw the Young British Artists, Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.\n\nThe auction was revived in 17th- and 18th-century England when auctions by candle began to be used for the sale of goods and leaseholds, some of which were recorded in Samuel Pepys's diary in 1660. Headquartered in King Street, London, Christie's, the world's largest auction house, was founded in 1766 by auctioneer James Christie in London. Known for his thickly impasted portrait and figure paintings, Lucian Freud was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time. Freud was depicted in Francis Bacon's 1969 oil painting, Three Studies of Lucian Freud, which was sold for $142.4 million in November 2013, the highest price attained at auction to that point.\n\nRandolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway, John Tenniel, Aubrey Beardsley, Roger Hargreaves, Arthur Rackham, John Leech, George Cruikshank and Beatrix Potter were notable book illustrators. Posters have played a significant role in British culture. Designed by Alfred Leete in 1914 as a recruitment poster for the British Army, \"Lord Kitchener Wants You\" is the most famous British recruitment poster ever produced and an iconic and enduring image of World War I. Produced by the British government in 1939 for World War II, the Keep Calm and Carry On motivational poster is now seen as \"not only as a distillation of a crucial moment in Britishness, but also as an inspiring message from the past to the present in a time of crisis\".\nIn the late 1960s, British graphic designer Storm Thorgerson co-founded the graphic art group Hipgnosis, who have designed many iconic single and album covers for rock bands. His works were notable for their surreal elements, with perhaps the most famous being the cover for Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. Designed and photographed by Brian Duffy, the Aladdin Sane album cover features a lightning bolt across his face which is regarded as one of the most iconic images of David Bowie. The subversive political artwork of Banksy (pseudonym of English graffiti artist whose identity is concealed) can be found on streets, walls and buildings in the UK and the rest of the world. Arts institutions include the Royal College of Art, Royal Society of Arts, New English Art Club, Slade School of Art, Royal Academy, and the Tate Gallery (founded as the National Gallery of British Art).\n\nDesign\n\nIn 2006, 37 years after its first test flight, Concorde was named the winner of the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. A total of 212,000 votes were cast with Concorde beating other British design icons such as the Mini, mini skirt, Jaguar E-Type, Tube map and the Supermarine Spitfire.\nSir Morien Morgan led research into supersonic transport in 1948 that culminated in the Concorde passenger aircraft. In November 1956 he became chairman of the newly formed Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee which funded research into supersonic transport at several British aviation firms though the 1950s. By the late 1950s, the committee had started the process of selecting specific designs for development, and after the forced merger of most aviation firms in 1960, selected the Bristol Type 223, designed by Archibald Russell, as the basis for a transatlantic design.\nThe Brit Awards statuette for the BPI's annual music awards, which depicts Britannia, the female personification of Britain, is regularly redesigned by some of the best known British designers, stylists and artists, including Dame Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Sir Peter Blake, Zaha Hadid and Sir Anish Kapoor.\n\n\n=== Performing arts, carnivals, parades ===\n\nLarge outdoor music festivals in the summer and autumn are popular, such as Glastonbury (the largest greenfield festival in the world), V Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals. The UK was at the forefront of the illegal, free rave movement from the late 1980s, which led to pan-European culture of teknivals mirrored on the British free festival movement and associated travelling lifestyle. The most prominent opera house in England is the Royal Opera House at Covent Gardens. The Proms, a season of orchestral classical music concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall, is a major cultural event held annually. The Royal Ballet is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies, its reputation built on two prominent figures of 20th-century dance, prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn and choreographer Frederick Ashton. Irish dancing is popular in Northern Ireland and among the Irish diaspora throughout the UK; its costumes feature patterns taken from the medieval Book of Kells.\nA staple of British seaside culture, the quarrelsome couple Punch and Judy made their first recorded appearance in Covent Garden, London in 1662. The various episodes of Punch and Judy are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy – often provoking shocked laughter – and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Regarded as British cultural icons, they appeared at a significant period in British history, with Glyn Edwards stating: \"[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of Puritanism. We soon changed Punch's name, transformed him from a marionette to a hand puppet, and he became, really, a spirit of Britain – a subversive maverick who defies authority, a kind of puppet equivalent to our political cartoons.\"\n\nThe circus is a traditional form of entertainment in the UK. Chipperfield's Circus dates back more than 300 years in Britain, making it one of the oldest family circus dynasties. Philip Astley is regarded as the father of the modern circus. Following his invention of the circus ring in 1768, Astley's Amphitheatre opened in London in 1773. As an equestrian master Astley had a skill for trick horse-riding, and when he added tumblers, tightrope-walkers, jugglers, performing dogs, and a clown to fill time between his own demonstrations – the modern circus was born. The Hughes Royal Circus was popular in London in the 1780s. Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal, among the most popular circuses of Victorian England, showcased William Kite, which inspired John Lennon to write \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" on The Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Joseph Grimaldi, originator of whiteface clown make-up, is considered the father of modern clowning.\nThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the world's largest arts festival. Established in 1947, it takes place in Scotland's capital during three weeks every August alongside several other arts and cultural festivals. The Fringe mostly attracts events from the performing arts, particularly theatre and comedy, although dance and music also feature. The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual event that has taken place on the streets of Notting Hill, London since 1966. Led by the British African-Caribbean community, the carnival has attracted around one million people, making it Britain's biggest street festival and one of the largest in the world. \nAlso of note is the extensive impact of Irish culture for St. Patrick's Day. The largest St Patrick's Day Parade takes place in Digbeth, Birmingham, where there is a strong Irish community.\n\nPantomime (often referred to as \"panto\") is a British musical comedy stage production, designed for family entertainment. It is performed in theatres throughout the UK during the Christmas and New Year season. The art originated in the 18th century with John Weaver, a dance master and choreographer at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. In 19th-century England it acquired its present form, which includes songs, slapstick comedy and dancing, employing gender-crossing actors, combining topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience sing along with parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers, such as \"It's behind you\".\nPantomime story lines and scripts are almost always based on traditional children's stories: some of the popular British stories featured include Jack and the Beanstalk, Peter Pan, Babes in the Wood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Dick Whittington and His Cat. Plot lines are almost always adapted for comic or satirical effect, and characters and situations from other stories are often interpolated into the plot. For example, Jack and the Beanstalk might include references to English nursery rhymes involving characters called \"Jack\", such as Jack and Jill. Famous people regularly appear in Pantos, such as Ian McKellen. McKellen has also appeared at gay pride marches, with Manchester Pride one of 15 annual gay pride parades in the UK; the largest in Brighton attracts over 300,000.\n\nMusic hall is a British theatrical entertainment popular from the early Victorian era to the mid-20th century. The precursor to variety shows of today, music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts and variety entertainment. Music hall songs include \"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\", \"Hokey cokey\", \"I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside\" and \"The Laughing Policeman\". British performers who honed their skills at pantomime and music hall sketches include Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, George Formby, Gracie Fields, Dan Leno, Gertrude Lawrence, Marie Lloyd and Harry Champion. British music hall comedian and theatre impresario Fred Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s, and Chaplin and Laurel were notable music hall comedians who worked for him. Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\". Film producer Hal Roach stated; \"Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him.\" Examples of variety shows that evolved from the music hall include the Royal Variety Performance (first performed in 1912), which was broadcast on BBC radio from the 1920s, and then on television since the 1950s. Annually held in December (often at the London Palladium) and performed in front of members of the British Royal Family, many famous acts have performed at the Royal Variety show over the century, and since 2007 one act of the show has been selected by the British public through the ITV television talent show Britain's Got Talent.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture of the United Kingdom includes many features that precede the creation of the United Kingdom in 1707, from as early as Skara Brae and Stonehenge to the Giant's Ring, Avebury and Roman ruins. In most towns and villages the parish church is an indication of the age of the settlement. Many castles remain from the medieval period, such as Windsor Castle (longest-occupied castle in Europe), Stirling Castle (one of the largest and most important in Scotland), Bodiam Castle (a moated castle), and Warwick Castle. Over the two centuries following the Norman conquest of England of 1066, and the building of the Tower of London, castles such as Caernarfon Castle in Wales and Carrickfergus Castle in Ireland were built.\n\nEnglish Gothic architecture flourished from the 12th to the early 16th century, and famous examples include Westminster Abbey, the traditional place of coronation for the British monarch, which also has a long tradition as a venue for royal weddings; and was the location of the funeral of Princess Diana, Canterbury Cathedral, one of the oldest and most famous Christian structures in England; Salisbury Cathedral, which has the tallest church spire in the UK; and Winchester Cathedral, which has the longest nave and greatest overall length of any Gothic cathedral in Europe. Tudor architecture is the final development of Medieval architecture in England, during the Tudor period (1485–1603). In the United Kingdom, a listed building is a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. About half a million buildings in the UK have \"listed\" status.\nIn the 1680s, Downing Street was built by Sir George Downing, and its most famous address 10 Downing Street, became the residence of the Prime Minister in 1730. One of the best-known English architects working at the time of the foundation of the United Kingdom was Sir Christopher Wren. He was employed to design and rebuild many of the ruined ancient churches of London following the Great Fire of London. His masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed in the early years of the United Kingdom. Buckingham Palace, the London residence of the British monarch, was built in 1705. Both St Paul's Cathedral and Buckingham Palace use Portland stone, a limestone from the Jurassic period quarried in the Jurassic Coast in Portland, Dorset, which is famous for its use in British and world architecture.\nIn the early 18th century Baroque architecture – popular in Europe – was introduced, and Blenheim Palace was built in this era. However, Baroque was quickly replaced by a return of the Palladian form. The Georgian architecture of the 18th century was an evolved form of Palladianism. Many existing buildings such as Woburn Abbey and Kedleston Hall are in this style. Among the many architects of this form of architecture and its successors, neoclassical and romantic, were Robert Adam, Sir William Chambers, and James Wyatt.\n\nThe aristocratic stately home continued the tradition of the first large gracious unfortified mansions such as the Elizabethan Montacute House and Hatfield House. Many of these houses are the setting for British period dramas, such as Downton Abbey. During the 18th and 19th centuries in the highest echelons of British society, the English country house was a place for relaxing, hunting in the countryside. Many stately homes have become open to the public: Knebworth House, now a major venue for open air rock and pop concerts – Freddie Mercury's final live performance with Queen took place at Knebworth on 9 August 1986, Alton Towers, the most popular theme park in the UK, and Longleat, the world's first safari park outside Africa.\n\nIn the early 19th century the romantic Gothic revival began in England as a reaction to the symmetry of Palladianism. Notable examples of Gothic revival architecture are the Houses of Parliament and Fonthill Abbey. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, one could incorporate steel as a building component: one of the greatest exponents of this was Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace. Paxton also built such houses as Mentmore Towers, in the still popular retrospective Renaissance styles. In this era of prosperity and development British architecture embraced many new methods of construction, but such architects as August Pugin ensured that traditional styles were retained.\nFollowing the building of the world's first seaside pier in July 1814 in Ryde, Isle of Wight off the south coast of England, the pier became fashionable at seaside resorts in the UK during the Victorian era, peaking in the 1860s with 22 being built. Providing a walkway out to sea, the seaside pier is regarded as among the finest Victorian architecture, and is an iconic symbol of the British seaside holiday. By 1914, there were over 100 piers around the UK's coasts. Today there are 55 seaside piers in the UK. Tower Bridge (half a mile from London Bridge) opened in 1895.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century a new form of design, arts and crafts, became popular; the architectural form of this style, which had evolved from the 19th-century designs of such architects as George Devey, was championed by Edwin Lutyens. Arts and crafts in architecture is characterised by an informal, non-symmetrical form, often with mullioned or lattice windows, multiple gables and tall chimneys. This style continued to evolve until World War II. After that war, reconstruction went through a variety of phases, but was heavily influenced by Modernism, especially from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Many bleak town centre redevelopments—criticised for featuring hostile, concrete-lined \"windswept plazas\"—were the fruit of this interest, as were many equally bleak public buildings, such as the Hayward Gallery.\n\nMany Modernist-inspired town centres are today being redeveloped: Bracknell town centre is an example. However, in the immediate post-War years many thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of council houses in vernacular style were built, giving working-class people their first experience of private gardens and indoor sanitation. Many towns also feature statues or sculptures dedicated to famous natives. Modernism remains a significant force in British architecture, although its influence is felt predominantly in commercial buildings. The two most prominent proponents are Lord Rogers of Riverside and Norman Foster. Rogers' best known London buildings are probably Lloyd's Building and the Millennium Dome, while Foster created the 'Gherkin' and the City Hall. The Turner Prize winning artist Sir Anish Kapoor is an acclaimed contemporary British sculptors. A notable design is his ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture at the Olympic Park in London.\nDescribed by The Guardian as the 'Queen of the curve', Zaha Hadid liberated architectural geometry with the creation of highly expressive, sweeping fluid forms of multiple perspective points and fragmented geometry that evoke the chaos and flux of modern life. A pioneer of parametricism, and an icon of neo-futurism, with a formidable personality, her acclaimed work and ground-breaking forms include the aquatic centre for the London 2012 Olympics. In 2010 and 2011 she received the Stirling Prize, the UK's most prestigious architectural award, and in 2015 she became the first woman to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. Completed in 2012, the Shard London Bridge is the tallest building in the UK. Other major skyscrapers under construction in London include 22 Bishopsgate, and Heron Tower. Modernist architect Nicholas Grimshaw designed the Eden Project in Cornwall, which is the world's largest greenhouse.\n\n\n=== Comics ===\n\nBritish comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and Varney the Vampire). A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel throughout the UK via the invention of railway (in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. Created in the 1830s, The Guardian described penny dreadfuls as \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young\". Introducing familiar features in vampire fiction, Varney is the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire. After adult comics had been published – most notably Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (1880s) featuring Ally Sloper who has been called the first regular character in comics, – more juvenile British comics emerged, with the two most popular, The Beano and The Dandy, released by DC Thomson (based in Dundee, Scotland) in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the popularity of comics during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: \"When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s – and through really to the 1950s and 1960s – these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\"\nIn 1954 Tiger comics introduced Roy of the Rovers, the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books, graphic novels, and sequential art of various genres also flourished. These included fantasy and science fiction like Eagle, Valiant, Warrior, and 2000 AD. Other popular titles were war comics inspired by British military history like Commando, War Picture Library, and The Victor.\nCreated by Emma Orczy in 1903, the Scarlet Pimpernel is the alter ego of Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English fop who transforms into a formidable swordsman and a quick-thinking escape artist, establishing the \"hero with a secret identity\" into popular culture. The Scarlet Pimpernel first appeared on stage (1903) and then in novel (1905), and became very popular with the British public. He exhibits characteristics that became standard superhero conventions in comic books, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a scarlet pimpernel at his interventions). Drawing attention to his alter ego Blakeney he hides behind his public face as a meek, slow thinking foppish playboy, and he establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aid his endeavours.\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media, but were never before seen in American comics. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books that would jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his V for Vendetta, From Hell, Watchmen, Marvelman, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; Watchmen was described as \"paving the way for a current cultural obsession\" in comics; Neil Gaiman and his critically acclaimed and best-selling The Sandman mythos and Books of Magic; Warren Ellis creator of Transmetropolitan and Planetary; and others such as Alan Grant, Grant Morrison, Dave Gibbons, Alan Davis, and Mark Millar who created Wanted and Kick-Ass.\nProminent comic book artists include Steve Dillon, Simon Bisley, Dave McKean, Glen Fabry, John Ridgway and Sean Phillips. The comic book series Hellblazer, set in Britain and starring the Liverpudlian magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano, Mike Carey and Denise Mina.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\n\n\n=== Robin Hood and the ballad tradition ===\nMuch of the folklore of the United Kingdom pre-dates the 18th century. Though some of the characters and stories are present throughout all of the UK, most belong to specific countries or regions. Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales of Offa of Angeln and Weyland Smith, others date from after the Norman invasion of England, such as Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham. Richard the Lionheart, Christian leader of the Third Crusade, came to be seen as a contemporary and supporter of Robin Hood. A plaque features Richard marrying Robin and Maid Marian outside Nottingham Castle.\nDuring the High Middle Ages tales originated from Brythonic traditions, notably the Arthurian legend. Deriving from Welsh source; King Arthur, Excalibur and Merlin, while the Jersey poet Wace introduced the Knights of the Round Table. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.\nThe Loch Ness Monster is a cryptid that is reputed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. The legendary monster has been affectionately referred to by the nickname \"Nessie\" since the 1950s. The leprechaun figures large in Irish folklore. A mischievous fairy-type creature in emerald green clothing who when not playing tricks spends all its time busily making shoes, the leprechaun is said to have a pot of gold hidden at the end of the rainbow, and if ever captured by a human it has the magical power to grant three wishes in exchange for release. In mythology, English fairy tales such as Jack and the Beanstalk and Jack the Giant Killer helped form the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent, while the dwarf Tom Thumb is a traditional hero in English folklore.\nEnglish fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears is one of the most popular fairy tales in the English language. Some folk figures are based on semi- or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries: Lady Godiva, for instance, was said to have ridden naked on horseback through Coventry; the heroic English figure Hereward the Wake resisted the Norman invasion; Herne the Hunter is an equestrian ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park, and Mother Shipton is the archetypal witch. The chivalrous bandit, such as Dick Turpin, is a recurring character.\n\n\n=== Pirates ===\n\nPublished in 1724, A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson provided the standard account of the lives of many pirates in the Golden Age. It influenced pirate literature of Scottish novelists Robert Louis Stevenson (Treasure Island) and J. M. Barrie. Many famous English pirates from the Golden Age hailed from the West Country in south west England—the stereotypical West Country \"pirate accent\" was popularised by West Country native Robert Newton's portrayal of Stevenson's Long John Silver in film. The concept of \"walking the plank\" was popularised by Barrie's Peter Pan, where Captain Hook's pirates helped define the archetype. Davy Jones' Locker, where sailors or ships' remains are consigned to the bottom of the sea, is first recorded by Daniel Defoe in 1726. Johnson's 1724 book gave a mythical status to famous English pirates such as Blackbeard and Samuel Bellamy, alongside giving them various Jolly Roger's of dubious historical truth. The most famous Jolly Roger, the Crossed Swords Jolly Roger, was factiously attributed to English pirate John Rackham.\n\n\n=== Superstitions ===\n\nThe Gremlin is part of Royal Air Force folklore dating from the 1920s, with \"gremlin\" being RAF slang for a mischievous creature that sabotages aircraft, meddling in the plane's equipment. Legendary figures from 19th-century London whose tales have been romanticised include Sweeney Todd, the murderous barber of Fleet Street (accompanied with Mrs. Lovett who sells pies made from Todd's victims), and serial killer Jack the Ripper. On 5 November, people in Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by making bonfires and lighting fireworks in commemoration of the foiling of Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot, which became an annual event after the Observance of 5th November Act 1605 was passed. Guy Fawkes masks are an emblem for anti-establishment protest groups.\n\n\n=== Traditional non-religious holidays ===\n\nHalloween is a traditional and much celebrated holiday in Scotland and Ireland on the night of 31 October. The name \"Halloween\" is first attested in the 16th century as a Scottish shortening of the fuller All-Hallows-Even, and according to some historians has its roots in the Gaelic festival Samhain, when the Gaels believed the border between this world and the otherworld became thin, and the dead would revisit the mortal world. In 1780, Dumfries poet John Mayne makes note of pranks at Halloween; \"What fearfu' pranks ensue!\", as well as the supernatural associated with the night, \"Bogies\" (ghosts). Robert Burns' 1785 poem \"Halloween\" is recited by Scots at Halloween, and Burns was influenced by Mayne's composition.\nIn Scotland and Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include guising — children disguised in costume going from door to door requesting food or coins – which had become common practice by the late 19th century; (the Halloween masks, worn by children, are known as \"false faces\" in Ireland.) turnips hollowed out and carved with faces to make lanterns, and holding parties where games such as apple bobbing are played. Agatha Christie's mystery novel Hallowe'en Party is about a girl who is drowned in an apple-bobbing tub. Other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays. Further contemporary imagery of Halloween is derived from Gothic and horror literature (notably Shelley's Frankenstein and Stoker's Dracula), and classic horror films (such as Hammer Horrors). Mass transatlantic Irish and Scottish migration in the 19th century popularised Halloween in North America.\n\nWitchcraft has featured in the British Isles for millennia. The use of a crystal ball to foretell the future is attributed to the druids. In medieval folklore King Arthur's magician, the wizard Merlin, carried around a crystal ball for the same purpose. John Dee, consultant to Elizabeth I, frequently used a crystal ball to communicate with the angels. Probably the most famous depiction of witchcraft in literature is in Shakespeare's 1606 play Macbeth, featuring the three witches and their cauldron. The ghost of Anne Boleyn is a frequently reported ghost sighting in the UK. Differing accounts include seeing her ghost ride up to Blickling Hall in a coach drawn by a headless horseman, with her own head on her lap.\nNeopagan witchcraft began in England in the early 20th century with notable figures such as Aleister Crowley and the father of Wicca Gerald Gardner, before expanding westward in the 1960s. Settling down near the New Forest in Hampshire, Gardner joined an occult group through which he claimed to have encountered the New Forest coven into which he was initiated in 1939. Believing the coven to be a survival of the pre-Christian Witch-Cult, he decided to revive the faith, supplementing the coven's rituals with ideas borrowed from ceremonial magic and the writings of Crowley to form the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca. Moving to London in 1945, following the repeal of the Witchcraft Act 1735 Gardner became intent on propagating Wicca, attracting media attention and writing Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959). Crowley (the founder of Thelema) was described as \"the most notorious occultist magician of the 20th century\", and he remains an influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter-culture. His motto of \"Do What Thou Wilt\" is inscribed on the vinyl of Led Zeppelin's album Led Zeppelin III, and he is the subject of Ozzy Osbourne's single \"Mr Crowley\".\n\n\n== National parks, museums, libraries, and galleries ==\n\n\n=== Heritage administration ===\n\nEach country has its own body responsible for heritage matters.\nEnglish Heritage is the government body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England. It is currently sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The charity National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty has a contrasting role. Seventeen of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites are in England. Some of the best known of these include Hadrian's Wall, Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, Tower of London, Jurassic Coast, Westminster, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge, and Studley Royal Park. The northernmost point of the Roman Empire, Hadrian's Wall, is the largest Roman artefact anywhere: it runs a total of 73 miles in northern England.\nHistoric Environment Scotland is the executive agency of the Scottish Government, responsible for historic monuments in Scotland, such as Stirling Castle. The Old and New Town of Edinburgh is a notable Scottish World Heritage site. Balmoral Castle is the main Scottish residence of the British monarch. The Wallace Monument in Stirling contains artifacts believed to have belonged to Sir William Wallace, including the Wallace Sword. The Rob Roy Way, named after Scottish folk hero and outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor, is a long-distance footpath that runs for 92 miles. A statue of Robert the Bruce and a large monument and visitor centre (operated by the National Trust for Scotland) is located in Bannockburn near the site of the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nMany of Wales' great castles, such as the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd and other monuments, are under the care of Cadw, the historic environment service of the Welsh Government. Welsh actor Sir Anthony Hopkins donated millions to the preservation of Snowdonia National Park. The five most frequently visited Welsh castles are Caernarfon Castle, Conwy Castle, Caerphilly Castle, Harlech Castle and Beaumaris Castle. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency promotes and conserves the natural and built environment in Northern Ireland, and the Giant's Causeway on the north-east coast is one of the natural World Heritage sites. Tintagel Castle is a popular tourist destination in Cornwall, with the castle associated with the legend of King Arthur since the 12th century. There are 15 National Parks, including the Lake District in England, Snowdonia in Wales, and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park in Scotland\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nThe British Museum in London with its collection of more than seven million objects, is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world, and sourced from every continent, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginning to the present. On display since 1802, the Rosetta Stone is the most viewed attraction. The Natural History Museum, London was established by Richard Owen (who coined the term \"dinosaur\") to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits. The National Museums of Scotland bring together national collections in Scotland. Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales comprises eight museums in Wales. National Museums Northern Ireland has four museums in Northern Ireland including the Ulster Museum.\nThe Titanic Belfast museum, a visitor attraction in the Titanic Quarter, east Belfast, Northern Ireland on the regenerated site of the shipyard where Titanic was built, was opened to the public in 2012. The architecture is a tribute to Titanic itself, with the external facades a nod to the enormous hull of the ocean liner.\nThe first Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in London in 1835, and today displays waxworks of famous people from various fields, including royalty (Princess Diana), historical figures (Henry VIII), sport (David Beckham), music (Freddie Mercury), literature (Charles Dickens), politics (Winston Churchill), television (Gordon Ramsay), and cinema (Michael Caine) among others.\nThe most senior art gallery is the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, which houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Tate galleries house the national collections of British and international modern art; they also host the famously controversial Turner Prize. The National Galleries of Scotland are the five national galleries of Scotland and two partner galleries. The National Museum of Art, Wales, opened in 2011.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe British Library in London is the national library and is one of the world's largest research libraries, holding over 150 million items in all known languages and formats; including around 25 million books. The library has two of the four remaining copies of the original Magna Carta (the other two copies are held in Lincoln Castle and Salisbury Cathedral) and has a room devoted solely to them. The British Library Sound Archive has over six million recordings (many from the BBC Sound Archive, including Winston Churchill's wartime speeches.)\nThe National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh holds 7 million books, 14 million printed items (such as the last letter written by Mary, Queen of Scots) and over 2 million maps. The National Library of Wales is the national legal deposit library of Wales, and holds over 6.5 million books, portraits, maps and photographic images in Wales.\n\n\n=== Historical markers ===\n\nBlue plaques are the oldest historical marker scheme in the world. The scheme was proposed by politician William Ewart in 1863 and was initiated in 1866 by the Society of Arts. Since 1986 it has been run by English Heritage.\nThe first plaque was unveiled in 1867 to commemorate Lord Byron at his birthplace, 24 Holles Street, Cavendish Square, London. Events commemorated by plaques include John Logie Baird's first demonstration of television at 22 Frith Street, Westminster, W1, London, the first sub 4-minute mile run by Roger Bannister on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, and a sweet shop in Llandaff, Cardiff that commemorates the mischief by a young Roald Dahl who put a mouse in the gobstoppers jar.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\nFrom the time of the Scientific Revolution, England and Scotland, and thereafter the United Kingdom, have been prominent in world scientific and technological development. The Royal Society serves as the national academy for sciences, with members drawn from different institutions and disciplines. Formed in 1660, it is one of the oldest learned societies still in existence.\nSir Isaac Newton's publication of the Principia Mathematica ushered in what is recognisable as modern physics. The first edition of 1687 and the second edition of 1713 framed the scientific context of the foundation of the United Kingdom. He realised that the same force is responsible for movements of celestial and terrestrial bodies, namely gravity. He is the father of classical mechanics, formulated as his three laws and as the co-inventor (with Gottfried Leibniz) of differential calculus. He also created the binomial theorem, worked extensively on optics, and created a law of cooling.\n\nFigures from the UK have contributed to the development of most major branches of science. John Napier introduced logarithms in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell unified the electric and magnetic forces in what are now known as Maxwell's equations. Following his publication of A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field in 1865, Maxwell predicted the existence of radio waves in 1867. James Joule worked on thermodynamics and is often credited with the discovery of the principle of conservation of energy.\nNaturalist Charles Darwin wrote On the Origin of Species and discovered the principle of evolution by natural selection. James Hutton, founder of modern geology, worked on the age of the Earth (deep time) which forms a key element of Darwin's theory. Other important geologists include Charles Lyell, author of Principles of Geology, who also coined the term Pleistocene, and Adam Sedgwick, who proposed (and coined) the name of the Cambrian Period. William Thomson (Baron Kelvin) drew important conclusions in the field of thermodynamics and invented the Kelvin scale of absolute zero. Paul Dirac was one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics. Botanist Robert Brown discovered the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (Brownian motion). John Stewart Bell created Bell's Theorem. Harold Kroto discovered buckminsterfullerene.\nOther 19th- and early 20th-century British pioneers in their field include Joseph Lister (antiseptic surgery), Edward Jenner (vaccination), Richard Owen (palaeontology, coined the term Dinosaur), Florence Nightingale (nursing), Sir George Cayley (aerodynamics), William Fox Talbot (photography), and Howard Carter (modern archaeology, discovered Tutankhamun).\nScholarly descriptions of dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th-century England. Between 1815 and 1824, William Buckland discovered fossils of Megalosaurus and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal. The second dinosaur genus to be identified, Iguanodon, was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell. In 1832, Gideon Mantell discovered fossils of a third dinosaur, Hylaeosaurus. Owen recognised that the remains of the three new species that had been found so far shared a number of distinctive features. He decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group, dinosaurs.\nJohn Harrison invented the marine chronometer, a key piece in solving the problem of accurately establishing longitude at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel. The most celebrated British explorers include James Cook, Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Drake, Henry Hudson, George Vancouver, Sir John Franklin, David Livingstone, Captain John Smith, Robert Falcon Scott, Lawrence Oates and Ernest Shackleton. The aquarium craze began in Victorian England when Philip Henry Gosse created and stocked the first public aquarium at London Zoo in 1853, and coined the term \"aquarium\" when he published The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854. Robert FitzRoy pioneered weather forecasting: the first daily weather forecasts were published in The Times in 1861.\n\nA crucial advance in the development of the flush toilet was the S-trap invented by Alexander Cumming in 1775 – it uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. In 1824 Charles Macintosh invented the waterproof raincoat; the Mackintosh (mac) is named after him. William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1824. The first commercial electrical telegraph was co-invented by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. They patented it in May 1837 as an alarm system, and it was first successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 between Euston and Camden Town in London.\nPostal reformer Sir Rowland Hill is regarded as the creator of the modern postal service and the inventor of the postage stamp (Penny Black) — with his solution of pre-payment facilitating the safe, speedy and cheap transfer of letters. Hill's colleague Sir Henry Cole introduced the world's first commercial Christmas card in 1843. In 1851 Sir George Airy established the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, London, as the location of the prime meridian where longitude is defined to be 0° (one of the two lines that divide the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres). George Boole authored The Laws of Thought which contains Boolean algebra. Forming the mathematical foundations of computing, Boolean logic laid the foundations for the information age.\n\nHistorically, many of the UK's greatest scientists have been based at either Oxford or Cambridge University, with laboratories such as the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford becoming famous in their own right. In modern times, other institutions such as the Red Brick and New Universities are catching up with Oxbridge. For instance, Lancaster University has a global reputation for work in low temperature physics.\nTechnologically, the UK is also amongst the world's leaders. Historically, it was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, with innovations especially in textiles, the steam engine, railroads, machine tools and civil engineering. Famous British engineers and inventors from this period include James Watt, Robert Stephenson, Richard Arkwright, Henry Maudslay and the 'father of Railways' George Stephenson. Maudslay's most influential invention was the screw-cutting lathe, a machine which created uniformity in screws and allowed for the application of interchangeable parts (a prerequisite for mass production): it was a revolutionary development necessary for the Industrial Revolution. The UK has the oldest railway networks in the world, with the Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825, the first public railway to use steam locomotives. Opened in 1863, London Underground is the world's first underground railway. Running along the East Coast Main Line between Edinburgh and London, the Flying Scotsman has been ranked the world's most famous steam locomotive.\nEngineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, another major figure of the Industrial Revolution, was placed second in a 2002 BBC nationwide poll to determine the \"100 Greatest Britons\". He created the Great Western Railway, as well as famous steamships including the SS Great Britain, the first propeller-driven ocean-going iron ship, and SS Great Eastern which laid the first lasting transatlantic telegraph cable. Josiah Wedgwood pioneered the industrialisation of pottery manufacture. In 1820, Scottish road builder John McAdam invented \"macadamisation\" for building roads with a smooth hard surface. In 1901, Edgar Purnell Hooley added tar to the mix and named it Tarmac (short for tarmacadam).\n\nProbably the greatest driver behind the modern use of concrete was Smeaton's Tower built by John Smeaton in the 1750s. The third Eddystone Lighthouse (the world's first open ocean lighthouse), Smeaton pioneered the use of hydraulic lime in concrete. Scotsman Robert Stevenson constructed the Bell Rock Lighthouse in the early 1800s. Situated 11 miles off east Scotland, it is the world's oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse. Portland cement, the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, was developed in England in the 19th century. It was coined by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 (he named it after Portland stone), and further developed by his son William Aspdin in the 1840s.\nThe UK has produced some of the most famous ships in the world: Harland and Wolff in Belfast built the RMS Titanic as well as her sister ships RMS Olympic and RMS Britannic; in Clydebank John Brown and Company built the RMS Queen Mary, RMS Queen Elizabeth and SS Queen Elizabeth 2; ships built in England include the Mary Rose (King Henry VIII's warship), the Golden Hind (Sir Francis Drake's ship for the circumnavigation of the globe between 1577 and 1580), HMS Victory (Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805), and HMS Beagle (ship used in Charles Darwin's five-year voyage). Other important British ships include HMS Endeavour (James Cook's ship in his first voyage of discovery), HMS Challenger (first global marine research expedition: the Challenger expedition), and Discovery (carried Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton in the Discovery Expedition, their first successful journey to the Antarctic). The Royal Navy troopship HMS Birkenhead is known for the first appearance of the \"women and children first\" protocol.\nSince then, the UK has continued this tradition of technical creativity. Alan Turing (leading role in the creation of the modern computer), Scottish inventor Alexander Graham Bell (the first practical telephone), John Logie Baird (world's first working television system, first electronic colour television), Frank Whittle (co-invented the jet engine) — powered by Whittle's turbojet engines, the Gloster Meteor was the first British jet fighter and the Allies' only jet aircraft to achieve combat operations during World War II, Charles Babbage (devised the idea of the computer), Alexander Fleming (discovered penicillin). The UK remains one of the leading providers of technological innovations, providing inventions as diverse as the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and Viagra by British scientists at Pfizer's Sandwich, Kent. Sir Alec Jeffreys pioneered DNA fingerprinting. Pioneers of fertility treatment Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, achieved conception through IVF (world's first \"test tube baby\") in 1978.\n\nThe prototype tank was constructed at William Foster & Co. in Lincoln in 1915, with leading roles played by Major Walter Gordon Wilson who designed the gearbox and developed practical tracks and by William Tritton whose company built it. This was a prototype of the Mark I tank, the first tank used in combat in September 1916 during WWI. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, was credited by Prime Minister David Lloyd George as being the driving force behind their production. Allan Beckett designed the 'Whale' floating roadway, crucial to the success of the Mulberry harbour used in the invasion of Normandy in WWII. In 1918, HMS Argus became the world's first aircraft carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft, and in WWII, HMS Ark Royal was involved in the first aerial and U-boat kills of the war, as well as the crippling of the German battleship the Bismarck in May 1941. In 1932, Cambridge engineer Francis Thomas Bacon invented the alkaline fuel cell which is used to generate power for space capsules and satellites.\nIntroduced in 1952, the de Havilland Comet was the world's first commercial jet airliner. Operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation (which merged with other British operators to form today's British Airways), on 2 May 1952 the flight registered G-ALYS took off with fare-paying passengers and inaugurated scheduled service from London to Johannesburg.\nIn 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), created by computer scientist Alexander S. Douglas, is regarded as a contender for the first video game. In OXO, the computer player could play perfect games of noughts and crosses against a human opponent. In the 1960s, John Shepherd-Barron invented the cash machine (ATM) and James Goodfellow invented Personal identification number (PIN) technology, and on 27 June 1967, the first cash machine was established outside a branch of Barclays Bank in Enfield, north London. Dolly the sheep, the first mammal successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell (by scientists at Roslin Institute in Edinburgh), became a celebrity in the 1990s.\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Britain due to the social, economic and political changes in the country during the previous centuries. The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the Glorious Revolution, in contrast to other European countries where absolute monarchy remained the typical form of government, can be said to be a factor in favouring Britain as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain. Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain also contributed, with the country's extensive coast lines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation. Britain also had high quality coal.\nHistorian Jeremy Black states, \"an unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions, transformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and urbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities appeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never be the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country, but the world itself.\"\n\nPottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood was one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the Industrial Revolution. Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Wedgwood created goods such as soft-paste porcelain tableware (bone china), which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables. Credited as a pioneer of modern marketing, Wedgwood pioneered direct mail, money back guarantees, travelling salesmen, carrying pattern boxes for display, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues. Other important figures in marketing and advertising in the 18th and 19th centuries were Thomas Chippendale, the London cabinet-maker who in 1754 produced the \"first comprehensive trade catalogue of its kind\", and Thomas J. Barratt, who became the first brand manager of a company (Pears soap) in 1865. In 1882, English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry was recruited by Barratt to become the poster-girl for Pears (which included putting her \"signature\" on the advertisements), as she became the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.\nDescribed as \"natural capitalists\" by the BBC, dynasties of Quakers were successful in business matters, and they contributed the Industrial Revolution in Britain. This included ironmaking by Abraham Darby I and his family; banking, including Lloyds Bank (founded by Sampson Lloyd), Barclays Bank, Backhouse's Bank and Gurney's Bank; life assurance (Friends Provident); pharmaceuticals (Allen & Hanburys); the big three British chocolate companies (Cadbury, Fry's and Rowntree); biscuit manufacturing (Huntley & Palmers); match manufacture (Bryant and May) and shoe manufacturing (Clarks). With his role in the marketing and manufacturing of James Watt's steam engine, and invention of modern coinage, Matthew Boulton is regarded as one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history. In 1861, Welsh entrepreneur Pryce Pryce-Jones formed the first mail order business, an idea which would change the nature of retail. Selling Welsh flannel, he created mail order catalogues, with customers able order by mail for the first time, and the goods were delivered by railway.\n\n\n=== Cars ===\n\nThe UK has had a long history of car making. Some of the best known British brands are Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin, McLaren, Jaguar, Land Rover, MG, and the Mini. Rolls-Royce was founded by Charles Stewart Rolls and Sir Frederick Henry Royce in 1906. In addition to the company's reputation for superior engineering quality in its cars, Rolls-Royce Limited was known for manufacturing the high-powered \"R\" engines, including the iconic Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine which was used for many World War II aircraft. Bentley Motors Limited was founded by W. O. Bentley in 1919 in Cricklewood, North London, and, like Rolls-Royce, is regarded as a British luxury automobile icon. Aston Martin was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford, and became associated with luxury grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and with the fictional British spy James Bond. Jaguar was founded in 1922. The Jaguar E-Type sports car was released in 1961; Enzo Ferrari called it \"the most beautiful car ever made\". Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the British Prime Minister. The company also holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. The Land Rover launched in 1948 and specialises in four-wheel-drive. Many models have been developed for the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Mini was released by the British Motor Corporation in 1959 and became a 1960s cultural icon. The performance versions, the Mini Cooper, was a successful rally car. The distinctive two-door Mini was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis. It has been named Britain's favourite car in a poll.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 years. Anglican churches remain the largest faith group in each country of the UK except Scotland, where Anglicanism is a small minority. The Presbyterian Church of Scotland is the national church in Scotland. Following this is Roman Catholicism and religions including Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Buddhism. Today British Jews number around 300,000; the UK has the fifth largest Jewish community worldwide.\n\nWilliam Tyndale's 1520s translation of the Bible was the first to be printed in English, and was a model for subsequent English translations, notably the King James Version in 1611. The Book of Common Prayer of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English, and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the English language.\nIn 17th-century England, the Puritans condemned the celebration of Christmas. In contrast, the Anglican Church \"pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days. The calendar reform became a major point of tension between the Anglicans and Puritans.\" The Catholic Church also responded, promoting the festival in a more religiously orientated form. King Charles I of England directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style Christmas generosity. Following the Parliamentarian victory over Charles I in the English Civil War, Puritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.\n\nProtests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities; and for weeks Canterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans. The book, The Vindication of Christmas (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and notes old English Christmas traditions: dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with \"plow-boys\" and \"maidservants\", old Father Christmas and carol singing. The Restoration of King Charles II in 1660 ended the ban.\n\nFollowing the Restoration, Poor Robins Almanack contained the lines:\n\nNow thanks to God for Charles return\nWhose absence made old Christmas mourn\nFor then we scarcely did it know\nWhether it Christmas were or no.\nThe diary of James Woodforde, from the latter half of the 18th century, details Christmas observance and celebrations associated with the season over a number of years.\nIn the early 19th century, writers imagined Tudor Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, Charles Dickens wrote the novel A Christmas Carol that helped revive the \"spirit\" of Christmas and seasonal merriment. Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, linking \"worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation.\" Superimposing his humanitarian vision of the holiday, termed \"Carol Philosophy\", Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas celebrated today in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games, and a festive generosity of spirit. A prominent phrase from the tale, \"Merry Christmas\", was popularised following its publication. The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, with \"Bah! Humbug!\" dismissive of the festive spirit. Tiny Tim says \"God bless us, every one!\" which he offers as a blessing at Christmas dinner. Dickens repeats the phrase at the end of the story; symbolic of Scrooge's change of heart.\n\nThe revival of the Christmas Carol began with William Sandys's Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern (1833), with the first appearance in print of \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\", \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" and \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\". In 1843 the first commercial Christmas card was produced by Henry Cole, leading to the exchange of festive greeting cards among the public. The movement coincided with the appearance of the Oxford Movement and the growth of Anglo-Catholicism, which led a revival in traditional rituals and religious observances.\nIn the UK, the Christmas tree was introduced in the early 19th century, following the personal union with the Kingdom of Hanover, by Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III. In 1832, the future Queen Victoria wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with lights, ornaments, and presents placed round it. After her marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, a hugely influential image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle was published in the Illustrated London News in 1848, after which the custom became more widespread throughout Britain.\nWhile 2001 census information suggests that over 75% of British citizens consider themselves to belong to a religion, Gallup reports that only 10% of British citizens regularly attend religious services. A 2004 YouGov poll found that 44% of British citizens believe in God, while 35% do not. Christmas and Easter are national public holidays in the UK. First broadcast over the Easter period in 1977, the two-part Jesus of Nazareth television miniseries, starring Robert Powell as Jesus, was watched by over 21 million viewers in the UK. In 1844 Sir George Williams founded YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) in London. The oldest and largest youth charity in the world, its aim is to support young people to belong, contribute and thrive in their communities. The Salvation Army is a Christian charity founded by William Booth and his wife Catherine in London's East End in 1865. It seeks to bring salvation to the poor, destitute and hungry.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\n\n=== The Crown and parliament ===\nThe UK has a parliamentary government based on the Westminster system that has been emulated around the world – a legacy of the British Empire. The Parliament of the United Kingdom that meets in the Houses of Parliament has two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed House of Lords, and any Bill passed requires Royal Assent to become law. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom: the devolved parliaments and assemblies in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are not sovereign bodies and could be abolished by the UK Parliament, despite each being established following public approval as expressed in a referendum.\nThe UK's two major political parties are the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, who between them won 532 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons at the most recent general election. Currently, the third biggest party in terms of seats in the Commons is the Liberal Democrats, or Lib Dems, which won 72 seats. The Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland is the forth largest, but only won 7 out of the 59 Scottish constituencies. There are also smaller parties in the Commons, like Reform UK and Green Party, or regional parties like Plaid Cymru (Wales), the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Democratic Unionist Party, and Sinn Féin (Northern Ireland).\n\nA prominent part of British political culture, Prime Minister's Questions – often referred to as \"PMQs\" – is held every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting. The Prime Minister spends around half an hour responding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs). In questioning the policies of government ministers, MP Amber Rudd states \"PMQs is central to our democracy.\" Due to the drama of the sessions, PMQs is among the best-known parliamentary business in the country. It is broadcast live on BBC News, Sky News and BBC Parliament television channels, as well as streamed online by many news outlets via numerous services, such as Twitch or YouTube.\nThe United Kingdom has an uncodified constitution, the Constitution of the United Kingdom, consisting mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including statutes, judge-made case law, and international treaties. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and constitutional law, the British Parliament can perform constitutional reform simply by passing Acts of Parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.\n\n\n=== The law ===\nBritish constitutional documents include Magna Carta (foundation of the \"great writ\" Habeas corpus — safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary state action), the Bill of Rights 1689 (one provision granting freedom of speech in Parliament), Petition of Right, Habeas Corpus Act 1679 and Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. A separate but similar document, the Claim of Right Act, applies in Scotland. Jurist Albert Venn Dicey wrote that the British Habeas Corpus Acts \"declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty\". An advocate of the \"unwritten constitution\", Dicey stated English rights were embedded in the general English common law of personal liberty, and \"the institutions and manners of the nation\".\nAccording to 2016 figures from the Ministry of Justice, there is a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury duty over the course of their lifetime. In Scotland the percentage is higher due to Scotland having a lower population as well having juries made up of fifteen people as opposed to twelve in England and Wales.\n\nThe 17th-century English patriot John Hampden was a leading parliamentarian involved in challenging the authority of Charles I when he refused to be taxed for ship money in 1637, and was one of the Five Members whose attempted unconstitutional arrest by the King in the House of Commons in 1642 sparked the English Civil War. The wars established the constitutional rights of parliament, a concept legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689. Since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting. Hampden is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed in the face of the monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch.\nOther important British political figures include Sir Edward Coke, 17th-century jurist; the legal directive that nobody may enter a home, which in the 17th-century would typically have been male owned, unless by the owners invitation or consent, was established as common law in Coke's Institutes of the Lawes of England. \"For a man's house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [and each man's home is his safest refuge].\" It is the origin of the famous dictum, \"an Englishman's home is his castle\". Sir William Blackstone, 18th-century jurist, judge and politician best known for his Commentaries on the Laws of England, containing his formulation: \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer\", a principle that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence, Emmeline Pankhurst, leading suffragette which helped win women the right to vote, William Wilberforce, leading parliamentary abolitionist. An influential thinker in the history of liberalism, 19th century philosopher, political economist and politician John Stuart Mill justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control. A member of the Liberal Party, he was also the first Member of Parliament to call for women's suffrage.\n\nRobert Walpole is generally regarded as the first British Prime Minister (1721–1742). Twice Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, founded the Conservative party (which was expanded by Benjamin Disraeli), and created the modern police force. Margaret Thatcher was the first female British Prime Minister (1979–1990). She became known as the \"Iron Lady\", a term coined by a Soviet journalist for her uncompromising politics and leadership style. In 1938, Neville Chamberlain believed he had secured \"Peace for our time\" with Germany, a year before WWII broke out.\nEnglish poet William Cowper wrote in 1785, \"We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad? Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs receive our air, that moment they are free, They touch our country, and their shackles fall. That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud. And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then, And let it circulate through every vein.\" Thomas Clarkson described fellow British abolitionist Josiah Wedgwood's 1787 anti-slavery medallion, \"Am I Not A Man And A Brother?\", as \"promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom\". Following the Slave Trade Act 1807, Britain pressed other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties, and in 1839 the world's oldest international human rights organisation, Anti-Slavery International, was formed in London, which worked to outlaw slavery abroad; Wilberforce's abolitionist colleague Thomas Clarkson was the organisation's first key speaker. The 1965 suspension of the death penalty for murder had been introduced to Parliament as a private member's bill by Sydney Silverman MP. The world's largest human rights organisation, Amnesty International, was founded by Peter Benenson in London in 1961.\n\n\n=== Honours system ===\nThe British honours system is a means of rewarding individuals' personal bravery, achievement or service to the United Kingdom. Candidates are identified by public or private bodies or by government departments or are nominated by members of the public. Nominations are reviewed by honours committees, made up of government officials and private citizens from different fields, who meet twice a year to discuss the candidates and make recommendations for appropriate honours to be awarded by the King.\nHistorically a knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. An example of warrior chivalry in medieval literature is Sir Gawain (King Arthur's nephew and a Knight of the Round Table) in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (late 14th century). Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the UK is damehood. The ceremony often takes place at Buckingham Palace, and family members are invited to attend.\nA few examples of knights are Sir Nicholas Winton: for \"services to humanity, in saving Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia\", Sir Elton John: for \"services to music and charitable services\", Sir Ridley Scott: for \"services to the British film industry\", and Sir Richard Branson: for \"services to entrepreneurship\". Examples of dames are: actress Dame Julie Andrews and singer Dame Shirley Bassey: both for \"services to the performing arts\", actress Dame Joan Collins: for \"services to charity\", and Dame Agatha Christie: for \"contribution to literature\".\n\n\n=== Counties ===\nThe suffix \"shire\" is attached to most of the names of English, Scottish and Welsh counties. Shire is a term for a division of land first used in England during the Anglo-Saxon period. Examples in England are Cheshire, Hampshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire; in Scotland, Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, Inverness-shire and Stirlingshire; and in Wales, Carmarthenshire, Flintshire and Pembrokeshire. This suffix tends not to be found in the names of counties that were pre-existing divisions. Essex, Kent, and Sussex, for example, have never borne a -shire, as each represents a former Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Similarly Cornwall was a British kingdom before it became an English county. The term \"shire\" is also not used in the names of the six traditional counties of Northern Ireland.\n\n\n=== Units of measurement ===\n\nUse of the British imperial system of measure, particularly among the public, is widespread in the United Kingdom and is in many cases permitted by the law. Human height and weight, long distances and speed are measured in imperial units by the vast majority of Brits. A Brit would normally give their weight as \"12 and a half stone\" rather than 80 kilograms, though younger people increasingly use kilograms rather than stone. Body height is usually given in feet and inches. Younger generations tend to use more metric units of measurement, creating a generational gap, for example in short distances and item weight. Although the majority of Brits now use degrees Celsius to measure temperature, the use of Fahrenheit persists in older generations. Distances shown on road signs must be in miles and yards, while miles per hour appear on speed limit signs and car speedometers.\nBritain has been transitioning to metric since 1965, when the UK Government announced financial support for metrication with a target of 10 years. When the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the UK re-affirmed its commitment to metrication, but in 2007, the European Commission abandoned completely the deadline for full metrication in the UK.\n\n\n=== Driving ===\nBy custom and law, traffic in Britain drives on the left. Research shows that countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than those that drive on the right, and it has been suggested that this is partly because the predominantly better-performing right eye is used to monitor oncoming traffic and the driver's wing mirror. The name of the zebra crossing is attributed to British MP and subsequent Prime Minister, James Callaghan, who in 1948 visited the Transport Research Laboratory which was working on a new idea for safe pedestrian crossings. On being shown a design he is said to have remarked that it resembled a zebra. Located in Birmingham, the Gravelly Hill Interchange's colloquial name \"Spaghetti Junction\" was coined by journalists from the Birmingham Evening Mail on 1 June 1965. In 1971, the Green Cross Code was introduced to teach children safer road crossing habits. From 1987, Mungo Jerry's song \"In the Summertime\" featured in drink driving adverts. The building of roundabouts (circular junctions) grew rapidly in the 1960s; there are now more than 10,000 in the UK The Cat's eye retroreflective safety device used in road marking was invented by Percy Shaw in 1933.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\n\nBritish cuisine is the specific set of cooking traditions and practices associated with the United Kingdom. Historically, British cuisine meant \"unfussy dishes made with quality local ingredients, matched with simple sauces to accentuate flavour, rather than disguise it\". International recognition of British cuisine was historically limited to the full breakfast and the Christmas dinner. However, Celtic agriculture and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for indigenous Celts. Anglo-Saxon England developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe. The Norman conquest introduced exotic spices into Great Britain in the Middle Ages. The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of India's food tradition of \"strong, penetrating spices and herbs\".\nEach country within the United Kingdom has its own specialities. Traditional examples of English cuisine include the Sunday roast; featuring a roasted joint, usually roast beef (a signature English national dish dating back to the 1731 ballad \"The Roast Beef of Old England\"), lamb or chicken, served with assorted boiled or roasted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy. The full English breakfast consists of bacon, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, baked beans, fried mushrooms, sausages and eggs. Black pudding and hash browns are often also included. It is usually served with tea or coffee. The Ulster version – Ulster fry – includes soda farl and potato bread, with the BBC's Simon Majumdar calling it the UK's best full breakfast.\n\nFish and chips are also regarded as a national institution: Winston Churchill called them \"the good companions\", John Lennon smothered them in tomato ketchup, while George Orwell referred to them as a \"chief comfort\" of the working class. The meal was created in 1860 in the East End of London by a Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, who came up with the idea of combining fried fish with chips. A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the 1860s origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries. Various meat pies are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, shepherd's pie, cottage pie, Cornish pasty and pork pie.\nA quintessential British custom, afternoon tea, is a small meal typically eaten between 4 pm and 6 pm. The most popular drink in Britain, tea became more widely drunk due to Catherine of Braganza. It is traditionally accompanied with biscuits, sandwiches, scones, cakes or pastries (such as Battenberg cake, fruit cake or Victoria sponge). In his 1946 essay \"A Nice Cup of Tea\", author George Orwell wrote: \"Tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country.\" McVitie's are the best selling biscuit brand in the UK, and the most popular biscuits to \"dunk\" in tea, with McVitie's chocolate digestives, rich tea and hobnobs ranked the nation's top three favourite biscuits. Other popular British biscuits include bourbons, custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, ginger nuts and shortbread. The first documented figure-shaped biscuits (gingerbread man) was at the court of Elizabeth I in the 16th century.\n\nThe first English recipe for ice cream was published in Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts in London in 1718, and arguably the earliest reference to an edible ice cream cone, appears in Charles Elmé Francatelli's 1846 The Modern Cook.\nThe 18th-century English aristocrat John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich is best known for his links to the modern concept of the sandwich which was named after him. When he ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread, others began to order \"the same as Sandwich!\". In the city of Leeds in 1767, Joseph Priestley made his \"happiest\" discovery when he invented carbonated water (also known as soda water), the major and defining component of most soft drinks. Carbonated lemonade was available in British refreshment stalls in 1833, with R. White's Lemonade sold in 1845. By 1887 they sold a wide variety of soft drink flavours. Irn-Bru is the best-selling soft drink in Scotland. Invented by a Newcastle pharmacist in 1927, Lucozade is the No. 1 sports drink in the UK.\nSausages are commonly eaten as bangers and mash, in sausage rolls or as toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot is a well-known stew. Popular cheeses include Cheddar and Wensleydale. Sweet British dishes include scones, apple pie, mince pies, spotted dick, Eccles cakes, pancakes, sponge cake, trifle, jelly, custard, sticky toffee pudding, Tunnock's teacake, and Jaffa cakes; the best-selling cake in the UK. Marmalade is a popular British spread for toast or sandwich: a spread famous for its association with Paddington Bear, a beloved bear in British culture that featured in the critically acclaimed films Paddington (2014) and Paddington 2 (2017).\n\nHome baking has always been a significant part of British home cooking. Influential cookbooks include The Experienced English Housekeeper (1769), Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845) by food author Eliza Acton that introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe, and Isabella Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861). Home-made cakes and jams are part of the traditional English village fête. Filmed in bunting-draped marquees in scenic gardens, the success of the 2010s television show The Great British Bake Off (which was inspired by the village fête) is credited with spurring a renewed interest in home baking, with supermarkets and department stores in the UK reporting sharp rises in sales of baking ingredients and accessories. A popular cake to bake, Victoria sponge (named after Queen Victoria who enjoyed a slice with her tea), was created following the discovery of baking powder by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843, which enabled the sponge to rise higher in cakes.\nThe hot cross bun is a popular British sweet bun traditionally eaten on Good Friday, but are now eaten all year round. Treacle tart was created after the invention of golden syrup by chemists working for Abram Lyle in 1885. With its logo and green-and-gold packaging having remained almost unchanged since then, Lyle's Golden Syrup was listed by Guinness World Records as having the world's oldest branding and packaging. Scottish cuisine includes Arbroath smokie and haggis; Northern Irish cuisine features the Ulster fry and the pastie and Welsh cuisine is noted for Welsh rarebit (often using Worcestershire sauce) and cawl. Brown sauce is a traditional British condiment, with its best known variety HP Sauce (named after and featuring an image of the Houses of Parliament on the label) a popular spread on chicken and bacon sandwiches. The Scottish Aberdeen Angus is a popular native beef breed, accounting for almost 20% of the UK beef industry. Cavendish bananas were cultivated by Sir Joseph Paxton in the greenhouses of Chatsworth House, Derbyshire in 1836. Named after William Cavendish, they make up the vast majority of bananas consumed in the western world.\n\nThe pub is an important aspect of British culture, and is often the focal point of local communities. Referred to as their \"local\" by regulars, pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work, the availability of a particular beer or ale or a good selection, good food, a social atmosphere, the presence of friends and acquaintances, and the availability of pub games such as darts or snooker. Pubs will often screen sports events, such as English Premier League and Scottish Premier League games (or for international tournaments, the FIFA World Cup). The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s.\nInitially created to draw in pre-literate drinkers, in 1393, Richard II introduced a law that pubs had to display a sign outdoors to make them easily visible for passing ale tasters who would assess the quality of ale sold. Most pubs still have decorated signs hanging over their doors. The owner or tenant (licensee) is known as the pub landlord or publican, while barmaids are a common feature in pubs. Alcoholic drinks served in pubs include wines and English beers such as bitter, mild, stout and brown ale. Whisky originated in Ireland and Scotland in the Middle Ages: Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky.\n\n \nOn Christmas Day, goose was previously served at dinner; however since appearing on Christmas tables in England in the late 16th century, the turkey has become more popular, with Christmas pudding served for dessert. The 16th-century English navigator William Strickland is credited with introducing the turkey into England, and 16th-century farmer Thomas Tusser noted that by 1573 turkeys were common in the English Christmas dinner. This custom gave rise to the humorous English idiom, \"like turkeys voting for Christmas\". The turkey is sometimes accompanied with roast beef or ham, and is served with stuffing, gravy, roast potatoes, mashed potatoes and vegetables. Invented in London in the 1840s, Christmas crackers are an integral part of Christmas celebrations, often pulled before or after dinner, or at parties.\n\nChinese restaurants and takeaways (in addition to Indian) are among the most popular ethnic food in the UK. Chinese takeaways are a common sight in towns throughout the UK, and many serve a pseudo-Chinese cuisine based on western tastes (such as chicken fried rice, chips and curry sauce).\nThe earliest recipe for the crisp (\"potato chip\") is in English food writer William Kitchiner's 1822 cookbook The Cook's Oracle. In 1920, Frank Smith of The Smiths Potato Crisps Company Ltd packaged a twist of salt with his crisps in greaseproof paper bags, which were sold around London. Crisps remained otherwise unseasoned until an important scientific development in the 1950s. After Archer Martin and Richard Synge (while working in Leeds) received a Nobel Prize for the invention of partition chromatography in 1952, food scientists began to develop flavours via a gas chromatograph, a device that allowed scientists to understand chemical compounds behind complex flavours such as cheese. In 1954, Irish crisps company Tayto produced the first seasoned crisps: Cheese & Onion. Golden Wonder (Smiths' main competitor in Britain) produced their Cheese & Onion version, and Smith's countered with Salt & Vinegar (tested first by their north-east England subsidiary Tudor) which launched nationally in 1967, starting a two-decade-long flavour war. The crisp market in the UK is led by Walkers (who introduced their own flavours in 1954), holding 56% of the market share.\n\nThe Quakers, founded by George Fox in 1650s England and described by the BBC as \"natural capitalists\", had a virtual monopoly in the British chocolate industry for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, led by Cadbury of Birmingham, Fry's of Bristol and Rowntree's and Terry's of York. Fry's produced the first chocolate bar in 1847, which was then mass-produced as Fry's Chocolate Cream in 1866. The chocolate bars Cadbury Dairy Milk, Galaxy and Kit Kat, are the three best selling bars in the UK. Cadbury Creme Eggs are the best selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million. Sponsored by Cadbury, the annual children's Easter egg hunt takes place in over 250 locations in the UK. Created in Doncaster, Yorkshire, Butterscotch boiled sweets is one of the town's best known exports. Created in Lancashire, Jelly Babies are among the British public's favourite sweets. After Eights are a popular after dinner mint. A stick of rock (a hard cylindrical stick-shaped boiled sugar) is a traditional British seaside sweet, commonly sold at seaside resorts throughout the UK such as Brighton, Portrush and Blackpool. A \"99 Flake\" (commonly called a \"99\") which consists of ice cream in a cone with a Cadbury Flake inserted in it, is a hugely popular British dessert.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nMost of the major sports have separate administrative structures and national teams for each of the countries of the United Kingdom. Though each country is also represented individually at the Commonwealth Games, there is a single 'Team GB' (for Great Britain) that represents the UK at the Olympic Games. With the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th-century Victorian Britain, in 2012, IOC President Jacques Rogge stated; \"This great, sports-loving country is widely recognized as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum\".\n\n\n=== Football ===\nBoth in participation and viewing, the most popular sport in the UK is association football. The sport's origin can be traced to English public school football games. The rules were first drafted in England in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley, and the UK has the oldest football clubs in the world. England is recognised as the birthplace of club football by FIFA, with Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857, the world's oldest football club. The home nations all have separate national teams and domestic competitions, most notably England's Premier League and FA Cup, and the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Cup. The top three Welsh football clubs feature in the English league system. The first international football match was between Scotland and England in 1872. Referred to as the \"home of football\" by FIFA, England hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup, and won the tournament. The British television audience for the 1966 World Cup final peaked at 32.30 million viewers, making it the most watched television event ever in the UK.\nThe four home nations have produced some of the greatest players in the game's history, including, from England, Bobby Moore and Gordon Banks; from Northern Ireland, George Best and Pat Jennings; from Scotland, Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Johnstone; and from Wales, Ian Rush and Ryan Giggs. The first recipient of the Ballon d'Or, Stanley Matthews was knighted while still a player. The English Premier League (formed in 1992 by member clubs of the old Football League First Division) is the most-watched football league in the world, and its biggest clubs include Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City. Scotland's Celtic and Rangers also have a global fanbase. Leicester City's 2016 Premier League title win is regarded among the greatest sporting upsets ever.\n\nThe best-placed teams in the domestic leagues of England and Scotland qualify for Europe's premier competition, the UEFA Champions League (European Cup). Previous winners from the UK are Liverpool, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Celtic, Chelsea and Aston Villa. The UEFA Champions League Anthem, written by Tony Britten and based on Handel's Zadok the Priest, is played before each game. Henry Lyte's Christian hymn \"Abide with Me\" is sung prior to kick-off at every FA Cup Final, a tradition since 1927.\nThe practice of \"jumpers for goalposts\" alludes to street/park football in the UK where jumpers would be placed on the ground and used as goalposts. This practice was referenced by singer Ed Sheeran in his DVD Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium as a nod to playing concerts at Wembley Stadium, the home of English football. Early references to dribbling come from accounts of medieval football games in England. Geoffrey Chaucer offered an allusion to such ball skills in 14th-century England. In The Knight's Tale (from the Canterbury Tales) he uses the following line: \"rolleth under foot as doth a ball\".\n\nFootball in Britain is renowned for the intense rivalries between clubs and the passion of the supporters, which includes a tradition of football chants, which are one of the last remaining sources of an oral folk song tradition in the UK. Chants include \"You're Not Singing Any More\" (or its variant \"We Can See You Sneaking Out!\"), sung by jubilant fans towards the opposition fans who have gone silent (or left early). Many teams in the UK have their own club anthem or have a song closely associated with them, for example \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by Liverpool-based rock band Gerry and the Pacemakers, and \"Local Hero\" by Dire Straits frontman and Newcastle United fan Mark Knopfler, is played before the start of every Liverpool and Newcastle home game.\nThroughout the UK, meat pies (as well as burgers and chips) is a traditional hot food eaten at football games either before kick-off or during half time. The purchase of a football programme (a pre-match magazine produced by the home team that gives details on that day's game, including player profiles, recent form, interviews etc.) is also part of the 'ritual' of attending a football match in the UK. The Football Association dropped its ban on floodlights in 1950, and night games attracted increasingly large crowds of fans–some of them unruly—as well as large television audiences. Architects built bigger stadia, and \"their cantilevered constructions dwarfing mean streets, supplanted the cathedral as a symbol of the city's identity and aspirations\".\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nThe modern game of golf originated in Scotland, with the Fife town of St Andrews known internationally as the \"home of golf\". and to many golfers the Old Course, an ancient links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18 hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2 March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records. The oldest known rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 in Leith.\nThe oldest golf tournament in the world, and the first major championship in golf, The Open Championship, first took place in Ayrshire, Scotland in 1860, and today it is played on the weekend of the third Friday in July. Golf's first superstar Harry Vardon, a member of the fabled Great Triumvirate who were pioneers of the modern game, won the Open a record six times. Since the 2010s, three Northern Irish golfers have had major success; Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and four time major winner Rory McIlroy. The biennial golf competition, the Ryder Cup, is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder who sponsored the event and donated the trophy. Sir Nick Faldo is the most successful British Ryder Cup player.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\nIn 1845, rugby union was created when the first rules were written by pupils at Rugby School, Warwickshire. A former pupil of the school William Webb Ellis, is often fabled with the invention of running with the ball in hand in 1823. The first rugby international took place on 27 March 1871, played between England and Scotland. By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had teams, and in 1883 the first international competition the annual Home Nations Championship took place. In 1888, the Home Nations combined to form what is today called the British and Irish Lions, who now tour every four years to face a Southern Hemisphere team. The Wales team of the 1970s, which included a backline consisting of Gareth Edwards, J. P. R. Williams and Phil Bennett who were known for their feints, sidesteps and attacking running rugby, are regarded as one of the greatest teams in the game – all three players were involved in The greatest try ever scored in 1973. Jonny Wilkinson scored the winning drop goal for England in the last minute of extra time in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final. The major domestic club competitions are the Premiership in England and the Celtic League in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and (since 2010) Italy. Of Cornish origin, the chant \"Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi!\" is associated with rugby union (and its personalised variant with football); it inspired the \"Maggie Maggie Maggie, Out Out Out!\" chant by opponents of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. In 1895, rugby league was created in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, as the result of a split with the other Rugby code. The Super League is the sports top-level club competition in Britain, and the sport is especially popular in towns in the northern English counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria. The Challenge Cup is the major rugby league cup competition.\n\n\n=== Tennis ===\n\nThe modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England in the 1860s, and after its creation, tennis spread throughout the upper-class English-speaking population, before spreading around the world. Major Walter Clopton Wingfield is credited as being a pioneer of the game. The world's oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, first occurred in 1877, and today the event takes place over two weeks in late June and early July. Created in the Tudor period in the court of Henry VIII, the English dessert Strawberries and cream is synonymous with the British summer, and is famously consumed at Wimbledon. The tournament itself has a major place in the British cultural calendar. The eight-time Slam winner and Britain's most successful player Fred Perry is one of only seven men in history to have won all four Grand Slam events, which included three Wimbledons. Virginia Wade won three Grand Slams, the most famous of which was Wimbledon in 1977, the year of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II (the Queen attended Wimbledon for the first time since 1962 to watch the final). The 2013 and 2016 Wimbledon champion, Scotland's Andy Murray, is Britain's most recent male Grand Slam winner. In 2021, Emma Raducanu became the most recent British female Grand Slam winner.\n\n\n=== Boxing ===\n\nThe 'Queensberry rules', the code of general rules in boxing, was named after John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry in 1867, that formed the basis of modern boxing. Britain's first heavyweight world champion Bob Fitzsimmons made boxing history as the sport's first three-division world champion. The 1980s saw the emergence of heavyweight Frank Bruno who would become hugely popular with the British public. In the 1990s, Chris Eubank, Nigel Benn, Steve Collins and Michael Watson had a series of fights against each other in the super-middleweight division, drawing audiences of up to 20 million in the UK. Eubank's eccentric personality made him one of the most recognisable celebrities in the UK along with the cocky \"Prince\" Naseem Hamed. The Nigel Benn vs. Gerald McClellan fight in 1995 drew 13 million. Other big draw fighters in the UK included Lennox Lewis, Joe Calzaghe and Ricky Hatton.\n\n\n=== Cricket ===\n\nThe modern game of cricket was created in England in the 1830s when round arm bowling was legalised, followed by the historical legalisation of overarm bowling in 1864. In 1876–77, England took part in the first-ever Test match against Australia. Influential to the development of the sport, W. G. Grace is regarded as one of the greatest cricket players, devising most of the techniques of modern batting. His fame endures; Monty Python and the Holy Grail uses his image as \"the face of God\" during the sequence in which God sends the knights out on their quest for the grail. The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 that has remained Test cricket's most famous contest, and takes place every two years to high television viewing figures. The County Championship is the domestic competition in England and Wales. England have hosted the Cricket World Cup five times, and are the reigning champions, having won in 2019.\n\n\n=== Horse racing ===\nOriginating in 17th and 18th-century England, the Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing. Horse racing was popular with the aristocrats and royalty of British society, earning it the title \"Sport of Kings\". Named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, The Derby was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the Triple Crown, preceded by the 2000 Guineas and followed by the St Leger. The name \"Derby\" has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.\nThe National Hunt horse race the Grand National, is held annually at Aintree Racecourse in early April. It is the most watched horse race in the UK, attracting casual observers, and three-time winner Red Rum is the most successful racehorse in the event's history. Red Rum is the best-known racehorse in the UK, named by 45% of Britons, with Black Beauty (from Anna Sewell's novel) in second with 33%.\nBolton company J.W. Foster and Sons's pioneering running spikes appear in the book, Golden Kicks: The Shoes that changed Sport. They were made famous by 1924 100 m Olympic champion Harold Abrahams who would be immortalised in Chariots of Fire, the British Oscar winning film. Foster's grandsons formed the sportswear company Reebok in Bolton.\n\n\n=== Motor sports ===\nThe 1950 British Grand Prix was the first Formula One World Championship race. Britain has produced some of the greatest drivers in Formula One, including Stirling Moss, Jim Clark (twice F1 champion), Graham Hill (only driver to have won the Triple Crown), John Surtees (only world champion in two and four wheels), Jackie Stewart (three-time F1 champion), James Hunt, Nigel Mansell (only man to hold F1 and IndyCar titles at the same time), Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton (seven-time champion). The British Grand Prix is held at Silverstone every July. Also, the United Kingdom is home to some of the most prestigious teams in Formula One, including McLaren and Williams. It is also home to the headquarters of six of the ten current F1 teams, including current champions Mercedes, four-time champions Red Bull Racing, Alpine and Aston Martin.\n\n\n=== National sporting events ===\nOther major sporting events in the UK include the London Marathon, and The Boat Race on the River Thames. The most successful male rower in Olympic history, Steve Redgrave won gold medals at five consecutive Olympic Games. Cycling is a popular physical activity in the UK. In 1888, inventor Frank Bowden founded the Raleigh Bicycle Company, and by 1913, Raleigh was the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world. The Raleigh Chopper was named in the list of British design icons. In 1965 Tom Simpson became the first British world road race champion, and in 2012 Bradley Wiggins became the first British Tour de France winner. Chris Froome has subsequently won the Tour de France four times (2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017). Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas won in 2018. Sprint specialist Mark Cavendish has won thirty Tour de France stages, putting him second on the all-time list.\n\nIn Ice Dance, many of the compulsory moves were developed by dancers from the UK in the 1930s. At the 1984 Winter Olympics, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won ice dancing gold with the highest-ever score for a single programme. The pair received perfect 6.0 scores from every judge for artistic impression, and twelve 6.0s and six 5.9s overall.\nAt the 1988 Winter Olympics, ski jumper Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards gained fame as an underdog. Eddie was portrayed by Taron Egerton in the 2016 biographical sports comedy-drama film Eddie the Eagle.\n\nA great number of major sports originated in the United Kingdom, including association football, golf, tennis, boxing, rugby league, rugby union, cricket, field hockey, snooker, darts, billiards, squash, curling and badminton, all of which are popular in Britain. Another sport invented in the UK was baseball, and its early form rounders is popular among children in Britain. Snooker and darts are popular indoor games: Stephen Hendry is the seven time world snooker champion, Phil Taylor is the 16 time world darts champion. Snooker player Alex Higgins (nicknamed The Hurricane) and darts player Eric Bristow (nicknamed The Crafty Cockney) are credited with popularising each sport.\nBodybuilder Reg Park was Mr Britain in 1946 and became Mr Universe in 1951, 1958 and 1965. Gaelic football is very popular in Northern Ireland, with many teams from the north winning the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship since the early 2000s. William Penny Brookes was prominent in organising the format for the modern Olympic Games, and in 1994, then IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch laid a wreath on Brooke's grave, and said, \"I came to pay homage and tribute to Dr Brookes, who really was the founder of the modern Olympic Games\".\nParticipation in women's team sport (in addition to profile in the media) has seen a rapid increase in recent years. Popular women's team sports include Netball Superleague formed in 2005, the FA WSL (women's football) formed in 2010 (Kelly Smith is seen as a leading figure in the game), Women's Six Nations Championship in rugby union, and Women's Cricket Super League.\n\n\n=== Sub-national sports ===\nThe Highland games are held throughout the year in Scotland as a way of celebrating Scottish and Celtic culture and heritage, especially that of the Scottish Highlands, with more than 60 games taking place across the country every year. Each December, the BBC Sports Personality of the Year is announced, an award given to the best British sportsperson of the year, as voted for by the British public. The public also votes for the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport each year which has also captured the imagination of the British public. Recipients have included Pelé (after winning his third World Cup in 1970), Muhammad Ali (after regaining the heavyweight title in 1974), Jonah Lomu (for his performances at the 1995 Rugby World Cup), Ronaldo (for his comeback in winning the 2002 World Cup), and Roger Federer (for his record eighth Wimbledon in 2017).\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nEach of the four countries of the UK has a publicly funded health care system referred to as the National Health Service (NHS). The terms \"National Health Service\" or \"NHS\" are also used to refer to the four systems collectively. All of the services were founded in 1948, based on legislation passed by the Labour Government that had been elected in 1945 with a manifesto commitment to implement the Beveridge Report recommendation to create \"comprehensive health and rehabilitation services for prevention and cure of disease\".\n\nThe NHS was born out of a long-held ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles: That it meet the needs of everyone, that it be free at the point of delivery, and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay. The NHS had a prominent slot during the 2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony directed by Danny Boyle, being described as \"the institution which more than any other unites our nation\", according to the programme. Cancer Research UK, Alzheimer's Research UK and Together for Short Lives are among hundreds of health charities in the UK.\nFlorence Nightingale laid the foundation of modern nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world, now part of King's College London. Nightingale wrote Notes on Nursing in 1859. The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools. The Nightingale Pledge is taken by many new nurses in the US (but not the UK), and the annual International Nurses Day (12 May) is celebrated around the world on her birthday. Her social reforms improved healthcare for all sections of society in the UK and around the world.\n\n\n== Pets ==\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\nIn the UK, about 40% of the population own a pet. The top pets in the UK for 2018 and 2019 were:\n\nDogs: 25%\nCats: 17%\nRabbits, indoor birds, guinea pigs, hamsters: ≈1%\nTortoises and Turtles: 0.7%\nLizards: 0.6%\nHowever, the population of pets in the UK declined from 71 million in 2013 (a significant peak) to 51 million in 2018. This decline has seen some reversal as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; an article published in May 2021 stated that a total of 3.2 million households in the UK had acquired a pet since the start of the pandemic, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers' Association.\n\n\n=== History ===\nFounded in 1824, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is the oldest and largest animal welfare organisation in the world.\n\nThe British Shorthair cat is the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). The breed's broad cheeks and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star. The cat's profile reads: \"When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'\". There are almost one million horses and ponies in the UK, with popular native breeds including Clydesdale horse (used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry), Thoroughbred (used in horse racing), Cleveland Bay (pull carriages in royal processions), Highland pony and Shetland pony.\nThe UK's indigenous dog breeds include the Bulldog, Jack Russell Terrier, Golden Retriever, Yorkshire Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Airedale Terrier, Beagle, Border Collie, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, English Cocker Spaniel, Scottish Terrier, Welsh Corgi, Bullmastiff, Greyhound, English Springer Spaniel and Old English Sheepdog.\nThe Kennel Club, with its headquarters in London, is the oldest kennel club in the world, and acts as a lobby group on issues involving dogs in the UK. Its main objectives are to promote the general improvement of dogs and responsible dog ownership. Held since 1891, Crufts is an annual dog show in the UK. The event takes place over four days in early March. In 1928, the very first winner of Best in Show at Crufts was Primley Sceptre, a greyhound.\n\n\n== National costume and dress ==\n\nAs a multi-national state, the UK has no single national costume. However, different countries within the United Kingdom have national costumes or at least are associated with styles of dress. Scotland has the kilt and Tam o'shanter, and tartan clothing – its pattern consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours – is a notable aspect of Gaelic culture. A traditional Welsh costume with Welsh hat is worn by some women during Eisteddfodau. In England, the topic of a national costume has been in debate, since no officially recognized clothing is anointed \"national\". However, the closest to an English national costume can be the smock or smock-frock in the Midlands and Southern England and the maud in Northern England. English Country Clothing is also popular among rural folk, flat caps and brogue shoes also forming part of the country clothing.\n\nCertain military uniforms such as the Beefeater or the Queen's Guard are considered to be symbolic of Englishness. Morris dancers or the costumes for the traditional English May dance are sometimes cited as examples of traditional English costume, but are only worn by participants in those events. Designed in 1849 by the London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler, the Bowler hat is arguably the most iconic stereotyped view of an Englishman (complete with Bowler and rolled umbrella), and was commonly associated with City of London businessmen. Traced back to the north of England in the 14th century, the flat cap is associated with the working classes in the UK. The flat cap has seen a 21st-century resurgence in popularity, possibly influenced by various British public figures wearing them, including David Beckham, Harry Styles and Guy Ritchie, with clothing sellers Marks & Spencer reporting that flat cap sales significantly increased in the 2010s. In 1856 William Henry Perkin discovered the first synthetic dye (Mauveine – a purple colour), which was suitable as a dye of silk and other textiles, helping to revolutionise the world of fashion.\nBurberry is most famous for creating the trench coat: they were worn by British soldiers in the trenches in World War I. Among various British youth subcultures, Dr. Martens boots (often referred to as DMs) have been the choice of footwear: in the 1960s skinheads started to wear them, and they later became popular among scooter riders, punks, and some new wave musicians. Male mods adopted a sophisticated look that included tailor-made suits, thin ties, button-down collar shirts, Chelsea boots and Clarks desert boots.\n\nBritish sensibilities have played an influential role in world clothing since the 18th century. Particularly during the Victorian era, British fashions defined acceptable dress for men of business. Key figures such as the future Edward VII, Edward VIII, and Beau Brummell, created the modern suit and cemented its dominance. Brummell is credited with introducing and establishing as fashion the modern man's suit, worn with a tie. The use of a coloured and patterned tie (a common feature in British school uniforms) indicating the wearer's membership in a club, regiment, school, professional association etc. stems from the 1880 oarsmen of Exeter College, Oxford, who tied the bands of their straw hats around their necks. The Wellington boot (first worn by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington) became a staple for outdoor wear.\nThe tradition of a white wedding is commonly credited to Queen Victoria's choice to wear a white wedding dress at her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, at a time when white was associated with purity and conspicuous consumption (because it was difficult to keep clean, and thus could not be worn by servants or labourers), and when it was the colour required of girls being presented to the royal court. The 1981 wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer became one of the most famous dresses in the world, and was considered one of the most closely guarded secrets in fashion history.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nLondon, as one of the world's four fashion capitals, is host to the London Fashion Week – one of the 'Big Four' fashion weeks. Organised by the British Fashion Council, the event takes place twice each year, in February and September. The current venue for most of the \"on-schedule\" events is Somerset House in central London, where a large marquee in the central courtyard hosts a series of catwalk shows by top designers and fashion houses, while an exhibition, housed within Somerset House itself, showcases over 150 designers. However, many \"off-schedule\" events, such as On|Off and Vauxhall Fashion Scout, are organised independently and take place at other venues in central London.\nBritish designers whose collections have been showcased at the fashion week include Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Stella McCartney. British models who have featured at the event include Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Jade Jagger, David Gandy, Cara Delevingne and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. For almost two decades, Princess Diana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world.\nFashion designer Mary Quant was at the heart of the \"Swinging London\" scene of the 1960s, and her work culminated in the creation of the miniskirt and hot pants. Quant named the miniskirt after her favourite make of car, the Mini. The Swinging London fashion scene has featured in films, and was spoofed in the Austin Powers comedy series. The English fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth is widely considered the father of Haute couture.\n\n\n== Symbols, flags, and emblems ==\n\nThe United Kingdom as a whole has a number of national symbols, as do its constituent nations. The Union Flag is the national flag of the United Kingdom. The first flag combined the cross of St George with the saltire of Saint Andrew to represent the Union of the Crowns in 1707. St Patrick's saltire was added when the Kingdom of Ireland was unified with Great Britain in 1801, and retained to represent Northern Ireland after partition in 1927. Wales has never been represented on the Union Flag, as in 1707 it was part of the Kingdom of England. Similarly, the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom only represents England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. England occupies the first and fourth quarters of the arms except in Scotland, when its arms take precedence. Britannia is the national personification of the UK, while John Bull is a personification used in satirical contexts, and the national animals are the lion and the bulldog.\nThe UK does not have a floral emblem, but each nation does. The Tudor rose represents England, a thistle Scotland, the flax flower and shamrock Northern Ireland, and the leek and daffodil Wales. The rose, shamrock and thistle are engrafted on the same stem on the coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Another major floral symbol is the remembrance poppy, which has been worn in Britain since 1921 to commemorate soldiers who have died in war. In the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday they are distributed by The Royal British Legion in return for donations to their \"Poppy Appeal\", which supports all current and former British military personnel.\n\n\n== Traditional communication and greeting cards ==\n\nA familiar sight throughout the UK, the red telephone box and Royal Mail red post box are considered British cultural icons. Designed by Sir Giles Gilbert in 1924, the red telephone box features a prominent crown representing the British government. The post pillar box was introduced in the 1850s during the reign of Queen Victoria following Sir Rowland Hill's postal reforms in the 1830s where the reduction in postal rates with the invention of the postage stamp (Penny Black) made sending post an affordable means of personal communication.\nThe red telephone box has appeared in British pop culture, such as in Adele's video \"Hello\", the front cover of One Direction's album Take Me Home, and the back cover of David Bowie's album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.\nThe world's first postcard was received by Theodore Hook from Fulham, London in 1840. The first pillar boxes had the distinctive Imperial cypher of Victoria Regina. Most pillar boxes produced after 1905 are made of cast iron and are cylindrical, and have served well throughout the reigns of George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II.\nThe sending and receiving of greeting cards is an established tradition in the UK, with card sending or card display in the home being an important part of British culture.\nSir Henry Cole devised the concept of sending greetings cards at Christmas time. Designed by John Callcott Horsley for Cole in 1843, the Christmas card accounts for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales in the UK, with over 600 million cards sold annually. The robin is a common sight in gardens throughout the UK. It is relatively tame and drawn to human activities, and is frequently voted Britain's national bird in polls. The robin began featuring on many Christmas cards in the mid-19th century. The association with Christmas arises from postmen in Victorian Britain who wore red jackets and were nicknamed \"Robins\"; the robin featured on the Christmas card is an emblem of the postman delivering the card.\nSending Valentine's Day cards became hugely popular in Britain in the late 18th century, a practice which has since spread to other nations. The day first became associated with romantic love within the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century, when the tradition of courtly love flourished. In Chaucer's Parlement of Foules (1382) he wrote; For this was on seynt Volantynys day. When euery bryd comets there to chese his make. The modern cliché Valentine's Day poem can be found in the 1784 English nursery rhyme Roses Are Red; \"The rose is red, the violet's blue. 'The honey's sweet, and so are you. Thou art my love and I am thine. I drew thee to my Valentine.\"\nIn 1797, a British publisher issued The Young Man's Valentine Writer which contained scores of suggested sentimental verses for the young lover unable to compose his own. In 1835, 60,000 Valentine cards were sent by post in the UK, despite postage being expensive. A reduction in postal rates (with the 1840 invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black) increased the practice of mailing Valentines, with 400,000 sent in 1841. In the UK just under half the population spend money on gifts. Other popular occasions for sending greeting cards in the UK are birthdays, Mother's Day, Easter and Father's Day.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nEach country of the United Kingdom has a separate education system. Power over education matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved but education in England is dealt with by the British government since there is no devolved administration for England.\n\n\n=== England ===\n\nMost schools came under state control in the Victorian era; a formal state school system was instituted after the Second World War. Initially, schools were categorised as infant schools, primary schools and secondary schools (split into more academic grammar schools and more vocational secondary modern schools). Under the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s most secondary modern and grammar schools were combined to become comprehensive schools. England has many independent (fee-paying) schools, some founded hundreds of years ago; independent secondary schools are known as public schools. Eton, Harrow, Shrewsbury and Rugby are four of the best-known. The nature and peculiarities of these Public schools have frequently featured in British literature. Prior to 1999, corporal punishment was allowed in such schools, whilst the use of corporal punishment was outlawed in state schools in 1987. Most primary and secondary schools in both the private and state sectors have compulsory school uniforms. Allowances are almost invariably made, however, to accommodate religious dress, including the Islamic hijab and Sikh bangle (kara).\n\nAlthough the Minister of Education is responsible to Parliament for education, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local education authorities.\nEngland's universities include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world: the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and University College London are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 QS World University Rankings. The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research. The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the Financial Times. Academic degrees in England are usually split into classes: first class (I), upper second class (II:1), lower second class (II:2) and third (III), and unclassified (below third class).\n\n\n=== Northern Ireland ===\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is responsible for education in Northern Ireland. Schools are administered by five Education and Library Boards covering different geographical areas.\n\n\n=== Scotland ===\n\nScotland has a long history of universal provision of public education which, traditionally, has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects rather than depth of education in a smaller range of subjects. The majority of schools are non-denominational, but by law separate Roman Catholic schools, with an element of control by the Roman Catholic Church, are provided by the state system. Qualifications at the secondary school and post-secondary (further education) levels are provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive Education and Enterprise, Transport & Lifelong Learning Departments. State schools are owned and operated by the local authorities which act as Education Authorities, and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school, with the world's oldest high school being the Royal High School, Edinburgh in 1505, which colonists spread to the New World owing to the high prestige enjoyed by the Scottish educational system). Schools are supported in delivering the National Guidelines and National Priorities by Learning and Teaching Scotland.\nFirst degree courses at Scottish universities are often a year longer than elsewhere in the UK, though sometimes students can take a more advanced entrance exam and join the courses in the second year. One unique aspect is that the ancient universities of Scotland award a Master of Arts degree as the first degree in humanities. The University of Edinburgh is among the top twenty universities in the world according to the QS World University Rankings 2011. It is also among the Ancient Universities of Great Britain.\n\n\n=== Wales ===\n\nThe National Assembly for Wales has responsibility for education in Wales. A significant number of students in Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of the Welsh language, and lessons in the language are compulsory for all until the age of 16. There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh medium education as part of the policy of promoting a fully bilingual Wales.\n\n\n=== Outdoor education ===\nScouting is the largest co-educational youth movement in the UK. Scouting began in 1907 when Robert Baden-Powell, Lieutenant General in the British Army, held the first Scout camp at Brownsea Island in Dorset, England. Baden-Powell wrote the principles of Scouting in Scouting for Boys in 1908. In July 2009, adventurer Bear Grylls became the youngest Chief Scout ever, aged 35. In 2010, scouting in the UK experienced its biggest growth since 1972, taking total membership to almost 500,000.\n\n\n== Sociological issues ==\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nThe UK (England in particular) has a relatively high population density so housing tends to be more closely packed than in other countries. Thus terraced houses are widespread, dating back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London.\nAs the first industrialised country in the world, the UK has long been urbanised. In the 20th century, suburbanisation led to a spread of semi-detached and detached housing. After the Second World War, public housing was dramatically expanded to create a large number of council estates. There are many historic country houses and stately homes in rural areas, though only a minority of these are still used as private living accommodation.\nIn recent times, more detached housing has started to be built. Also, city living has boomed, with city centre populations rising rapidly. Most of this population growth has been accommodated in new apartment blocks in residential schemes in many towns and cities. Demographic changes (see below) are putting great pressure on the housing market, especially in London and the South East.\n\n\n=== Living arrangements ===\n\nHistorically most people in the United Kingdom lived either in conjugal extended families or nuclear families. This reflected an economic landscape where the general populace tended to have less spending power, meaning that it was more practical to stick together rather than go their individual ways. This pattern also reflected gender roles. Men were expected to go out to work and women were expected to stay at home and look after the families.\n\nIn the 20th century the emancipation of women, the greater freedoms enjoyed by both men and women in the years following the Second World War, greater affluence and easier divorce have changed gender roles and living arrangements significantly. The general trend is a rise in single people living alone, the virtual extinction of the extended family (outside certain ethnic minority communities), and the nuclear family arguably reducing in prominence.\nFrom the 1990s, the break-up of the traditional family unit, when combined with low interest rates and other demographic changes, has created great pressure on the housing market, in particular on accommodation for \"key workers\" such as nurses, other emergency service workers and teachers, who are priced out of most housing, especially in the South East. Some research indicates that in the 21st century young people are tending to continue to live in the parental home for much longer than their predecessors.\n\n\n=== Happiness ===\nWhen Brits were asked to rate their happiness yesterday on a scale of 1 to 10 in 2018, respondent's mean answer was 7.54 (ranked 'High') in 2018. Northern Irish respondents were ranked the happiest of the United Kingdom (with a mean of 7.74), followed by the English (with 7.54), then the Scots (with 7.52) and finally the Welsh (with 7.51).\nHowever, only 25% of women and girls between the ages of 7 and 21 claim to be very happy, which has fallen from 41% in 2009. They claimed that it was due to the pressure from exams and social media, which exerted undue amounts of stress on them. In that category, the oldest were the least happy: 27% of young women aged 17 to 21 claimed they were not happy, compared to 11% in 2009. This negatively influenced their confidence by 61%, health by 50%, relationships by 49% and studying by 39%. 69% of respondents in that age group claimed school exams were the chief stressor, 59% felt pressure from social media was making them less happy, and compared to 5 years ago, more claimed they had experienced unkind, threatening or negative reactions on social media. The proportion of the population who knew someone with mental health issues rose from 62% in 2015 to 71% in 2018. Many young women and girls feel unsafe walking alone: over half aged from 13 to 21 have experienced harassment or know someone who has, and almost half feel unsafe using public transport.\n\n\n=== Feminism ===\nThe proportion of young girls considering themselves feminists has risen from 35% in 2013 to 47% in 2018. 36% of young women and girls aged 11 to 21 had spoken up about an issue that mattered to them, this rose from 28% in 2011 but only 60% felt they had been listened to. Girls have also become more interested in science, maths and technology. Girls are more likely to want to become leaders in their careers, 53% compared to 42% in 2016. Maria Miller said, \"#MeToo may have left its mark in Hollywood but for women and girls around the country their ambitions to succeed are still too often met with sexism. It's important more women and girls are now speaking out about how this behaviour undermines their confidence and mental health; but this harmful, negative behaviour has to be stopped\".\n\n\n== Naming conventions ==\nThe common naming convention throughout the United Kingdom is for everyone to have one or more given names (a forename, still often referred to as a \"Christian name\") usually (but not always) indicating the child's sex, and a surname (\"family name\"). A four-year study by the University of the West of England, which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th centuries to explain the origins of the surnames in the British Isles. The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to the British Isles; the most common in the UK are Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Taylor, Johnson, and Lee. Since the 19th century middle names (additional forenames) have become very common and are sometimes taken from the name of a family member.\nMost surnames of British origin fall into seven categories:\n\nOccupations e.g. Smith, Sawyer, Fuller, Brewer, Clark, Cooper, Cook, Carpenter, Bailey, Parker, Forrester, Head, Palmer, Archer, Hunt, Baker, Miller, Dyer, Walker, Woodman, Taylor, Turner, Knight, Slater, Mason, Weaver, Carter, Wright\nPersonal characteristics e.g. Short, Brown, Black, Whitehead, Young, Stout, Long, White\nGeographical features e.g. Pond, Bridge, Camp, Hill, Bush, Lake, Lee, Wood, Holmes, Forest, Underwood, Hall, Brooks, Fields, Stone, Morley, Moore, Perry\nPlace names e.g. Murray, Everingham, Burton, Leighton, Hamilton, Sutton, Flint, Laughton\nEstate For those descended from landowners, the name of their holdings, manor or estate\nPatronymics, matronymics or ancestral, often from a person's given name. e.g. from male name: Richardson, Jones (Welsh for John), Williams, Thomas, Jackson, Wilson, Thompson, Johnson, Harris, Evans, Simpson, Willis, Davies, Reynolds, Adams, Dawson, Lewis, Rogers, Murphy, Nicholson, Robinson, Powell, Ferguson, Davis, Edwards, Hudson, Roberts, Harrison, Watson, or female names Molson (from Moll for Mary), Gilson (from Gill), Emmott (from Emma), Marriott (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g. MacDonald, Forbes, Henderson, Armstrong, Grant, Cameron, Stewart, Douglas, Crawford, Campbell, Houston, Hunter) with \"Mac\" Irish and Scottish Gaelic for son.\nPatronal from patronage (Hickman meaning Hick's man, where Hick is a pet form of the name Richard) or strong ties of religion Kilpatrick (follower of Patrick) or Kilbride (follower of Bridget).\n\nTraditionally, Christian names were those of Biblical figures or recognised saints; however, in the Gothic Revival of the Victorian era, other Anglo Saxon and mythical names enjoyed something of a fashion among the literati. Since the 20th century, however, first names have been influenced by a much wider cultural base.\nFirst names from the British Isles include Jennifer, a Cornish form of Guinevere (Welsh: Gwenhwyfar) from Arthurian romance, which gained recognition after George Bernard Shaw used it for the main female character in his play The Doctor's Dilemma (1906): Jennifer first entered the top 100 most commonly used names for baby girls in England and Wales in 1934. The oldest written record of the name Jessica is in Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, where it belongs to the daughter of Shylock. Jessica is the seventh most popular name for baby girls in England and Wales in 2015. First appearing in 13th century England, Olivia was popularised by Shakespeare's character in the Twelfth Night (1602). Vanessa was created by Jonathan Swift in his poem Cadenus and Vanessa (1713). While it first appeared in late 16th century England, Pamela was popularised after Samuel Richardson named it as the title for his 1740 novel.\nSee also:\n\nMost popular names of England and Wales\nMost popular names of Northern Ireland\nMost popular names of Scotland\nMost common surnames in England\nMost common surnames in Northern Ireland\nMost common surnames in Scotland\nMost common surnames in Wales\n\n\n== See also ==\nBritish humour\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport (deals with Culture for England)\nMinister for Culture and External Affairs (deals with Culture for Scotland)\nShrove Tuesday (Pancake Day)\nApril Fools' Day\nLord Kitchener Wants You\nList of venues in the United Kingdom\nSocial history of Postwar Britain (1945–1979)\nSocial history of the United Kingdom (1979–present)\nCommonwealth of Nations – Culture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCulture\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport\nUnited Kingdom/Ireland for Visitors Archived 23 April 2013 at the Wayback Machine\nTelevision\nBBC television\nITV\nSky television\nRadio\nBBC radio",
      "summary": "The culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by its combined nations' history, its interaction with the cultures of Europe, the individual diverse cultures of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the impact of the British Empire. The culture of the United Kingdom may also colloquially be referred to as British culture. Although British culture is a distinct entity, the individual cultures of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are diverse. There have been varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness between these four cultures.British literature is particularly esteemed. The modern novel was developed in Britain, and playwrights, poets, and authors are among its most prominent cultural figures. Britain has also made notable contributions to theatre, music, cinema, art, architecture and television. The UK is also the home of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church in Wales, the state church and mother church of the Anglican Communion, the third-largest Christian denomination. Britain contains some of the world's oldest universities, has made many contributions to philosophy, science, technology and medicine, and is the birthplace of many prominent scientists and inventions. The Industrial Revolution began in the UK and had a profound effect on socio-economic and cultural conditions around the world.\nBritish culture has been influenced by historical and modern migration, the historical invasions of Great Britain, and the British Empire. As a result of the British Empire, significant British influence can be observed in the language, law, culture and institutions of its former colonies, most of which are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. A subset of these states form the Anglosphere, and are among Britain's closest allies. British colonies and dominions influenced British culture in turn, particularly British cuisine.\nSport is an important part of British culture, and numerous sports originated in their organised, modern form in the country including cricket, football, boxing, tennis and rugby. The UK has been described as a \"cultural superpower\", and London has been described as a world cultural capital. A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the UK ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.\n\n",

      "title": "Autism Sunday",
      "content": "Autism Sunday, also known as the International Day of Prayer for Autism and Asperger Syndrome, is an event observed annually on the second Sunday of February.\n\n\n== History ==\nAutism Sunday was first held in 2002 during Autism Awareness Year in the United Kingdom. It was initiated by parents and carers Ivan Corea and Charika Corea, founders of the Autism Awareness Campaign UK. Parents of Charin, a teenager with autism spectrum disorder and a communication disorder, urged leaders of religious organisations, churches, community groups and world leaders around the globe to speak up for people with autism spectrum disorders.\n\nThe first service for autism was held in February 2002 at St Paul's Cathedral in London. Former Education Ministers, peers from the House of Lords, celebrities, writers, broadcasters, and the media joined children and people at St Paul's Cathedral to pray for children and adults with autism spectrum disorders, as well as their parents and caregivers.\nIn 2008, the first Early day motion on Autism Sunday was tabled in the House of Commons, in the Palace of Westminster. The motion, EDM 874, was sponsored by David Drew MP and signed by 71 members of Parliament. It calls on the Government to work with all faith communities in order to reach out to parents, caregivers and people with autism spectrum disorders in local communities, and urges church leaders and community groups of all denominations to engage with people with autism spectrum disorders. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron extended his personal support for Autism Sunday.\n\n\n== Debate in the House of Commons ==\nAutism Sunday was mentioned in a debate in the House of Commons in the British Parliament. David Taylor MP mentioned the day and called for action stating that the \"Churches and other religious organisations will be supporting an international day of prayer for those with autism and Asperger's syndrome. Will the Leader of the House take this as a bid as a topical debate on the issue, which affects hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country? The conditions are under-recognised and under-resourced and they badly need a national strategy, a national task force and a well resourced plan for the future.\"\nIn reply, the Leader of the Commons, Harriet Harman MP said: \"For many years, families have struggled to support and care for children with autism, often to a great extent on their own and without the proper back-up of integrated services. There is now a great deal more awareness of the difficulties of autism and Asperger's syndrome, and a recognition of the importance of early diagnosis and integrated services. I congratulate the Churches on picking this for an international day of prayer, and we would like to work with the Churches, local government and the voluntary sector to ensure that families with a family member who develops autism or Asperger's have the backing that they need in future.\"\n\n\n== International Day of Prayer for Autism and Asperger Syndrome ==\n\nChurches of all denominations around the world now honor the millions of people with autism on Autism Sunday, the International Day of Prayer for Autism and Asperger Syndrome. Organisers estimate there are 60 million people with autism around the world. Campaigners have said that many suffer without proper public services in education, health, specialist speech therapy and respite care in several parts of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia. The credit crunch and the global recession which hit many countries in 2008-2009 also affected the Autism Community. In the UK, people were concerned about the cuts to disability benefits and cuts to public services. Homes were re-possessed during the economic downturn and some families below the poverty line had to choose between heating and eating. \nWorld church leaders have been supporting Autism Sunday. Pope Benedict XVI told the organisers that he would be praying for the autism community on Autism Sunday. Some of the largest churches in the United States, including Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, have pledged to pray for over 60 million people with autism spectrum disorders on Autism Sunday. Support came from the Bishop of London in the United Kingdom, Right Reverend Richard Chartres.\nThe organizers have urged parents, carers and the worldwide Autism Community to use Autism Sunday as a platform to lobby and campaign on the serious issues. Support for Autism Sunday 2011 came from the Chilean Miner, Jose Henriquez, the 24th miner to be rescued from the San Jose mine. Henriquez was invited by US President Barack Obama to address the Presidential Prayer Breakfast in February 2011. He met Ivan Corea and Charika Corea, the Founders of Autism Sunday in the UK, prior to his departure to Washington, D.C. They presented him with his first-ever autism awareness ribbon. The news of the presentation was relayed by the media in Chile. Jose Henriquez released a special message in support of Autism Sunday 2011.\nCampaigners around the world organized an Autism Sunday Twitter Storm to mark Autism Sunday 2011 - to celebrate the lives of all people with autism. In 2022, a commemorative event has been planned in India.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutism\nAutistic Pride Day\nWorld Autism Awareness Day\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAutism Sunday Official Website\nAutism Sunday Blog\nAutism Sunday Website\nAutism Sunday - Act on Autism Church Urged - Church Times UK Feature\nPoem Video made by Janice L.

      "title": "Bachelor's Day (tradition)",
      "content": "Bachelor's Day, sometimes known as Ladies' Privilege, is an Irish tradition by which women are allowed to propose to men on Leap Day, 29 February, based on a legend of Saint Bridget and Saint Patrick. It once had legal basis in Scotland and England.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe tradition is supposed to originate from a deal that Saint Bridget struck with Saint Patrick. In the 5th century, Bridget is said to have gone to Patrick to complain that women had to wait too long to marry because men were slow to propose, asking that women be given the opportunity. Patrick is said to have offered that women be allowed to propose on one day every seven years, but Bridget convinced him to make it one day every four years.\nThe tradition also has background in the number of late February proposals encouraged by how undesirable it was to be unmarried during Lent, because of social responsibility to marry combined with the ban on marrying during the Lent observance. People who were single by Easter would be publicly named in Skellig Lists, ballads about single people, and harassed in the streets from the Sunday after Shrove Tuesday, known as Chalk Sunday, and throughout Lent. The term \"Skellig List\" comes from the name of the Skellig Islands and particularly the largest, Skellig Michael, where Lent was believed to start later than in the rest of Ireland, providing a last opportunity to quickly wed.\nBachelor's Day was well established by the 1800s. Several stories of the tradition were then collected by the Irish Folklore Commission between 1937 and 1939, as part of an educational curriculum project.\n\n\n== Irish tradition ==\nThe custom is reported to allow women to initiate dances and propose marriage. There are also traditions for if the proposal was refused, namely that the man would have to give recompense to the woman. This could come in different forms, though typically the man was expected to buy the woman gloves, a silk gown or, by the mid-20th century, a fur coat. He may have also had to perform a juggling trick on Easter Day. In some areas a woman could propose for the entire leap year.\nA related tradition is Puss Sunday. On either the last Sunday before, or the first Sunday after, Ash Wednesday, single women were reported to \"have a puss\", from the word pus being a term for scowling, but on Leap Years men would have the puss. This appears to be a kinder form of Chalk Sunday. Some records also include mention that it is traditionally unlucky to actually marry in February of a Leap Year.\n\n\n== Internationally ==\nSimilar traditions can be found in other countries, particularly in Scotland. It is also observed in other parts of the United Kingdom and in Finland. By the early 20th century, the tradition had reached the United States, but was treated misogynistically.\nIn some parts of Europe, if a woman proposed and the man refused, he would have to buy her twelve pairs of gloves, supposedly to hide the fact she was not wearing a ring.\n\n\n=== Scotland ===\nIrish monks took the tradition to Scotland. It has been widely reported that in 1288, it was made into a law that women could propose during leap years, that they must wear a red petticoat while proposing, and that refusals would result in a fine. This was supposedly decreed by the young, unmarried Queen Margaret, who was in fact 5 years old at the time. The \"fine\" could be a kiss, or the traditional silk dress or gloves. However, the fine and the red petticoat having the force of law have no basis in historical fact, though there was a superstition that a man declining such a proposal from a woman wearing a red petticoat would have bad luck. \nThe fine comes from the story of Saint Bridget and Saint Patrick, where Bridget is said to have immediately proposed to Patrick after he allowed women to, but Patrick turned her down, giving her a kiss on the cheek and a silk dress.\n\n\n=== England ===\nIn traditional English law, 29 February was not a legal day, so the legal bar at that time on women proposing would not apply during a leap year. This may have begun the tradition there.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThe first record of the tradition in the United States is in 1860, when Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that his daughter had mentioned a \"leap year dance\", where the men sit around waiting to be invited by the women. It became more known in the early 20th century, but was the butt of jokes about unmarried, romantically aggressive, women. Cartoons were published mocking the concept in various forms, commonly depicting women discussing the use of, or using, aggressive measures like nets and guns to capture unwitting men. The societal impact of the tradition in the United States has been described as reinforcing gender stereotypes that suggest women should not propose, as it was treated as a joke to let them do so on Leap Day; a similar American tradition was to have women take leadership positions and arbitrarily run local councils on Leap Day, which was treated similarly to suggest that women should not have these roles. Both traditions died out by 1980, when women's roles in relationships were more equal (and when the workplace swap became seen as entirely misogynistic).\nThe 2010 American film Leap Year tells the story of a woman traversing around Ireland to find her boyfriend to propose on the day, and the tradition may have led to the day being used as Sadie Hawkins Day.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Bhangra (music)",
      "content": "Bhangra (Punjabi pronunciation: [ˈpə̀ŋɡ(ə)ɽaː] ) is a type of non-traditional music of Punjab originating from the Punjab region.\nOver the years, bhangra has evolved and gained popularity not only in South Asia but also around the world. It has become a significant part of the cultural identity of the Punjabi diaspora in countries like Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Prior to this musical fusion, bhangra existed only as a dance form in the native Punjab. This Punjabi music was unique in that it was not traditional nor did it seek any authenticity. While the traditional folk music of Punjab has a set of melodies that are used by various singers, bhangra was a form of strict \"band culture\" in that new melodies were composed for each song. Therefore, the musicians were as important as the singers. \n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe roots of modern bhangra music date back to the Sikh Punjabi community in Punjab during the 1960s. An early pop music and modern recording group of this type of music in the United Kingdom was Bhujhangy Group, founded by Tarlochan Singh Bilga, Balbir Singh Khanpur, Gurpal, Rajinder Dhona and Dalvir Kahanpuri in Birmingham in 1971. Bhujhangy Group's first major hit was \"Bhabiye Akh Larr Gayee\". It was written by Tarlochan Singh Bilga in the early 1970s and was released on Birmingham's Oriental Star Agencies label. This was the first bhangra song to combine traditional Asian music with modern Western instruments.\n\n\n=== Differences from folk music ===\nAlthough bhangra music used many of the elements of Punjabi folk music (e.g., \"Bakkrey Bulaaney\" – the goat herding vocalizations), it was also radically different in its embrace of modernity. The song structure of a typical bhangra song featured four verses, a chorus, along with two alternating instrumental bridge sections. (e.g., CVB1CVB2CVB1CVB2C.) Hence it featured more musicianship than its folk predecessor.\n\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nA modern and commercial form of bhangra music was said to rise in Britain in the 1970s by Punjabi immigrants who took their native folk music and began experimenting by altering it using instruments from their host country. The new genre quickly became popular in Britain replacing Punjabi folk singers due to it being heavily influenced in Britain by the infusion of rock music and a need to move away from the simple and repetitive Punjabi folk music. It indicated the development of a self-conscious and distinctively rebellious British Asian youth culture centred on an experiential sense of self, e.g., language, gesture, bodily signification, desires, etc., in a situation in which tensions with British culture and racist elements in British society had resulted in alienation in many minority ethnic groups, fostered a sense of need for an affirmation of a positive identity and culture, and provided a platform for British Punjabi males to assert their masculinity.\nIn the 1980s, distributed by record labels such as Multitone Records, bhangra artists were selling over 30,000 cassettes a week in the UK, but no artists reached the Top 40 UK chart despite these artists outselling popular British ones; most of the bhangra cassette sales were not through the large UK record stores, whose sales were those recorded by the Official UK Charts Company for creating their rankings.\nThe group Alaap was formed in 1977, co-founded by Channi Singh and Harjeet Gandhi who both hailed from Southall, a Punjabi area in London. Their album Teri Chunni De Sitaray was released in 1982 by Multitone. Alaap was considered the first and original superstar bhangra band formed in the United Kingdom. Channi Singh has been awarded the OBE by the Queen for his services to bhangra music and services/charity for the British Asian community. Co-founder Harjeet Gandhi died in 2003.\nThe 1980s is commonly known as the golden age, or the age of bhangra music, which lasted roughly from 1985 to 1993. The primary emphasis during these times was on the melody/riff, played out usually on a synthesizer, harmonium, accordion or guitar. Folk instruments were rarely used.\nOne of the biggest bhangra stars of the last several decades is Malkit Singh and his band Golden Star. Singh was born in June 1963 in the village of Hussainpur in Punjab. He attended the Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jalandhar, in Punjab in 1980 to study for a bachelor of arts degree. There he met his mentor, Professor Inderjit Singh, who taught him Punjabi folk singing and bhangra dancing. Due to Singh's tutelage, Malkit entered and won song contests during this time. In 1983, he won a gold medal at the Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar, Punjab, for performing his song \"Gurh Nalon Ishq Mitha\", which later featured on his first album, Nach Gidhe Wich. The lyrics were by Tarlochan Singh Bilga and it was released in 1985. This album was created with Manager, Tarlochan Singh Bilga(TSB). The band has toured 27 countries. Malkit has been awarded the MBE by the Queen for his services to bhangra music.\nBhangra boy band, the Sahotas, were composed of five brothers from Wolverhampton. Their music is a fusion of bhangra, rock and dance.\nHeera, formed by Bhupinder Bhindi and fronted by Kumar and Dhami, was one of the most popular bands of the 1980s. \nBands like Alaap and Heera incorporated rock-influenced beats into bhangra, because it enabled \"Asian youth to affirm their identities positively\" within the broader environment of alternative rock as an alternative way of expression. However, some believe that the progression of bhangra music created an \"intermezzo culture\" post-India's partition, within the unitary definitions of Southeast Asians within the diaspora, thus \"establishing a brand new community in their home away from home\".\nSeveral other influential groups appeared around the same time, including The Saathies, Premi Group, Bhujungy Group, and Apna Sangeet. Apna Sangeet, best known for their hit \"Mera Yaar Vajavey Dhol\", re-formed for charity in May 2009 after a break-up.\nWhen bhangra and General Indian sounds and lyrics were combined, British-Asian artists began incorporating them in their music. Some Asian artists such as Bally Sagoo and Talvin Singh are creating their own form of British hip-hop.\nThis era also brought about bhangra art, which like the bhangra music it represented was rebellious. Unlike folk music art, which consisted of a picture of the folk singer, bhangra recordings had details such as distinctive artwork, logos, clever album names and band/musician listings (who played what).\n\n\n=== Folk backlash ===\nUnlike bhangra, folk music depends on a set number of traditional melodies that may be hundreds of years old. Each new singer simply writes new lyrics using one of those melodies.\nIn the mid-1990s, many artists, attracted to the economics of a bandless singer only act that technology such as karaoke machines now enabled, returned to the original, traditional folk beats away from bhangra music, often incorporating more dhol drum beats and tumbi. This time also saw the rise of several young Punjabi folk singers as a backlash to bhangra music. They were aided by DJs who mixed hip-hop samples with folk singing.\nBeginning around 1994, there was a trend towards the use of samples (often sampled from mainstream hip hop) mixed with traditional folk rhythm instruments, such as the tumbi and dhol. Using folk instruments and hip-hop samples, along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from Punjab, Punjabi folk music was able to cause the decline of bhangra music.\nPioneering DJs instrumental in the decline of bhangra were Bally Sagoo and Panjabi MC. As DJs who were initially hired by bhangra labels to remix the original recordings on the label's roster (OSA and Nachural respectively), they along with the record labels quickly found that remixing folk singers from India was much cheaper than working with outsourced bhangra bands.\nA pioneering folk singer that was instrumental in bhangra's demise was Jazzy B, who debuted in 1992. Having sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, Folk and Funky, he is now one of the best-selling Punjabi folk artists in the world, with a vocal style likened to that of Kuldip Manak.\nOther influential folk artists include Surinder Shinda – famous for his \"Putt Jattan De\" – Harbhajan Mann, Manmohan Waris, Sarbjit Cheema, Hans Raj Hans, Sardool Sikander, B21, Paaras and Bombay Talkie.\nBy the end of the 1990s, bhangra music had largely declined and been replaced with Punjabi folk singers. The same folk singers which bhangra bands had replaced a decade earlier were being utilized by DJs to make relatively inexpensive live music on laptops. This \"folkhop\" genre was short lived as records could not be officially released due to nonclearance copyrights on samples used to create the \"beat\". This continued until the end of the century. Folk-hop record labels such as Hi-Tech were investigated by BPI (British Phonographic Industry) for copyright infringement by way of uncleared samples on releases by folk DJs such as DJ Sanj.\n\nToward the end of the decade, bhangra continued to decline, with folk-hop artists such as Bally Sagoo and Apache Indian signing with international recording labels Sony and Island. Moreover, Multitone Records, one of the major recording labels associated with bhangra in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, was bought by BMG. A recent Pepsi commercial launched in Britain featured South Asian actors and Punjabi folk music.\n\n\n=== 2000s remixes ===\n\nPunjabi folk remixed with hip-hop, known as folkhop, is most often produced when folk vocals are purchased online to be remixed in a studio. Folk vocals are usually sung to traditional melodies, that are often repeated with new lyrics.\nSome South Asian DJs, especially in America, have mixed Punjabi folk music with house, reggae, and hip-hop to add a different flavour to Punjabi folk. These remixes continued to gain popularity as the 1990s came to an end. \nA notable remix artist is Bally Sagoo, a Punjabi-Sikh, Anglo-Indian raised in Birmingham, England. Sagoo described his music as \"a bit of tablas, a bit of the Indian sound. But bring on the bass lines, bring on the funky-drummer beat, bring on the James Brown samples\", to Time magazine in 1997. He was recently signed by Sony. Daler Mehndi, a Punjabi singer from India has a type of music known as \"folk pop\". Mehndi has released tracks such as \"Bolo Ta Ra Ra\" and \"Ho Jayegee Balle Balle\". His song \"Tunak Tunak Tun\" was released in 1998.\n\n\n== Canada and the United States ==\n\nPunjabi immigrants have encouraged the growth of Punjabi folk music in the Western hemisphere rather than bhangra music. The bhangra industry has grown in North America much less than in the United Kingdom.\nNorth American (non bhangra) folk artists such as Manmohan Waris, Jazzy Bains, Kamal Heer, Harbhajan Mann, Sarabjit Cheema, and Debi Makhsoospuri have emerged and the remix market has grown.\nIn 2001, Punjabi folk, and its hip-hop form, folkhop, began to exert an influence over US R&B music, when Missy Elliott released the folkhop-influenced song \"Get Ur Freak On\". In 2003, a version of Panjabi MC's \"Mundian To Bach Ke\" (\"Beware of the Boys\") featured U.S. rapper Jay-Z. Additionally, American rapper Pras of The Fugees recorded tracks with British alternative bhangra band Swami. American singer and actress Selena Gomez released her bhangra-influenced single \"Come & Get It\" from her first solo album Stars Dance in 2013.\n\n\n== Lyrics ==\n\nBhangra lyrics, which generally cover social issues or love, are sung in Punjabi. Bhangra lyrics were generally kept deliberately simple by the creators of the genre because the youth did not understand complex lyrics. Traditional Punjabi folk lyrics are generally more complex and often tell the tales of Punjabi history. There are many bhangra songs devoted to Punjabi pride themes and Punjabi heroes. The lyrics are tributes to the cultural traditions of Punjab. In particular, many bhangra tracks have been written about Udham Singh and Bhagat Singh. Less serious topics include beautiful women with their colourful duppattas. Lyrics can also be about crops and the coming of a new season. Bhangra is sung fiercely with strong lyrics often yelling: \"balle balle\" or \"chakde phate\", which refer to celebration and/or pride.\nNotable bhangra or Punjabi lyricists include Harbans Jandu who wrote \"Giddhian Di Rani\".\n\n\n== Instruments ==\n\nPunjabi instruments contribute to bhangra. Originally this was primarily the dhol. The 20th century has brought changes to the instruments that define bhangra, to include the tumbi, sarangi, dholak (smaller than the dhol), flute, zither, fiddle, harmonium, tabla, guitar, mandolin, saxophone, synthesizer, drum set, and other Western instruments. Perhaps the most famous bhangra instrument is the dhol. It is a double-sided barrel drum that creates the beat to which bhangra is danced. The person who plays the instrument, the dholi, plays various beats to create the different bhangra segments, such as Dhamaal, Jhummar, One side of the dhol has thicker skin, which creates a deeper sound, and the other side has a thinner skin, resulting in a higher-pitched sound. Two sticks are used to play the dhol instrument. The thicker stick, called the dagga, is used to play the bass side. The thinner tilli is used to play the treble side. Both sticks are usually made of wood or bamboo.\nThe string instruments include the guitar (both electrical), bass, sitar, tumbi, veena, violin and sarangi. The snare, toms, dhadd, dafli, dholki, and damru are the other drums. The tumbi, originally played by folk artists such as Lalchand Yamla Jatt and Kuldip Manak in true folk recordings and then notably used by Chamkila, a Punjabi folk (not bhangra) singer, is a high-tone, single-string instrument and Chimta by (Late) Alam Lohar.\n\n\n== Cultural impact and resurgence of Punjabi folk music in the West ==\n\nThe third and fourth generation are generally unable to speak Punjabi if their parents could hardly speak it. There is a move towards Punjabi folk music which is the purest form of Punjabi music. Much of the youth struggle to understand the lyrics, although, there are some children and young adults who have maintained their folk roots. Another reason why some fans express an anti-folk sentiment is that many folk songs were written for the dominant Jatts clan whereas Sikhs do not believe in castes, so they disapproved of Punjabi folk music. However, today with artists like Jazzy B, PMC, Sukhshinder Shinda and Diljit Dosanjh, Punjabi folk has increased in popularity although it is fused in some cases. iTunes has catalogs of many Punjabi folk singers available.\nAnother cause of the resurgence of Punjabi folk music is due to the increased popularity of bhangra in areas like the UK, Canada and U.S. Bhangra has become more accessible through social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, for the younger generation. In addition, multiple universities, across the UK, US and Canada have teams as well as academies being set up by senior dancers separate from universities. This resurgence has led to a desire for more traditional folk songs and beats, but also a learning opportunity for children of their cultures.\n\n\n== Derivatives ==\n\n\n=== Bhangragga ===\nBhangragga or bhangramuffin is a term for the style of music incorporating elements of bhangra and dancehall (or ragga, short for the word Raggamuffin) created by British Asian producers Simon and Diamond on the debut album by Apache Indian No Reservations (1993).\nThe sound is very percussion-heavy – a distinct holdover from bhangra – with a propulsive beat clearly designed for dancing. The dancehall influence can be felt through the use of pre-programmed music, similar to Dancehall \"riddims\".\nLyrically, the style features a combination of Sub-Continental-accented (usually Indian) vocals delivered in the clipped style associated with dancehall – and sometimes including the Patois of the latter style.\nThis style is almost exclusively a British phenomenon, as the two cultures involved in its genesis mix reasonably freely there. The most successful exponent, however, is Apache Indian, who had a worldwide hit with \"Boom Shack-A-Lak\", which was included on the soundtrack to the film Dumb and Dumber, among others.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bhangra artists\nMusic of Punjab\nPunjabi culture\nAsian Underground\nMultitone records\nDhol\nPunjab region\nMusic of the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWhere Bhangra Lives\nBhangra News, Music Videos & Interviews\nwww.Bhangra.org\nHouse Of Bhangra\nIndia Music – The first ever Indian Music domain and web site registered.",
      "summary": "Bhangra (Punjabi pronunciation: [ˈpə̀ŋɡ(ə)ɽaː] ) is a type of non-traditional music of Punjab originating from the Punjab region.\nOver the years, bhangra has evolved and gained popularity not only in South Asia but also around the world. It has become a significant part of the cultural identity of the Punjabi diaspora in countries like Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Prior to this musical fusion, bhangra existed only as a dance form in the native Punjab. This Punjabi music was unique in that it was not traditional nor did it seek any authenticity. While the traditional folk music of Punjab has a set of melodies that are used by various singers, bhangra was a form of strict \"band culture\" in that new melodies were composed for each song. Therefore, the musicians were as important as the singers. \n\n",

      "title": "BIT (alternative information centre)",
      "content": "BIT was an information service, publisher, travel guide and social centre founded in 1968 by John \"Hoppy\" Hopkins. It pre-dated the Internet as a free service that would try to find any information asked for, but post-dated library reference desks, and derived its name from the smallest unit of computer information.\n\n\n== BIT ==\nBIT was initially a partial spin-off from Hoppy's earlier International Times information service, which was being overwhelmed by the number of enquiries it was receiving, then subsequently took on a life of its own, becoming a much wider organisation more akin to the later social centres. Emerging from the UK underground as a volunteer-run business, it evolved into a collective and open house based in Notting Hill above the Badge Boutique.\nAlthough often undefinable, one staff member tried with \"We're open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm (telephone 24 hours) and we give free help and information about anything to anyone who wants it. Dirty, untidy office; friendly, sometimes exuberant atmosphere, inefficient staff, confused clientele, aggressive cat. Free information, free bogs, free bath. free duplicator and typewriter, free kittens and puppies, free clothes, free food — cheap at other times but free if you're really starving, free people to talk to, free alternative library, free day-room to freak out in or sleep in, free crashpad, lots of other free floor space depending on the season, free optimism, free ecstasy, free lots of other things plus expensive travel guides to pay for it all.\"\nIn the beginning of the 1970s, Nicholas Albery, just back from a stay in Haight-Ashbury, started getting involved with this newly set \"Information Service\", and quickly became a driving force in the development of wider activities for BIT, so that it became one of the first Social centres in London Area. Around 1972–73, at the peak of its activities and with the momentum given by Nicholas, BIT Info-Service ran 24 hours on 24, with \"BIT-workers\" coming up at around 10 PM to take their night shift, receiving and helping incomers from all over the world, until around 8:00 AM, when the \"day-team\" showed up.\n\n\n== BIT Guide ==\nThe BIT Guide, an early duplicated stapled-together \"foolscap bundle\" with a pink cover and with the title Overland to India and Australia, provided information for those travelling across Asia for the first time. Updated by those already on the road, it warned of pitfalls and suggested places to see and stay. The first BIT Guide was produced by the BIT Information & Help Service in London in 1970. The fourth edition (1975) was published by the Crisis-BIT Trust. The BIT guide reached its peak under the guidance of founding editor Geoff Crowther, who arrived at BIT in 1972 and later became a prolific travel writer for Lonely Planet and was instrumental to the company's rise during the early days.\n\n\n== Community Levy for Alternative Projects ==\nIn 1974 BIT became the coordinating centre for Community Levy for Alternative Projects, an invitation to supply funds for, generally, fledgling alternative projects, partly targeting shops and businesses that identified with counter-cultural ideas and aspirations.\n\n\n== Free festivals ==\nBIT also ran early festival services, providing help and information for festival patrons, which were rarely supplied by the organisers of big corporate events, such as the Isle of Wight Festival, and were often an integral part of the organisation of free festivals such as Windsor Free Festival. Alongside Release, Festival Welfare Services and more occasionally IT, Oz and the White Panthers they provided a countercultural safety-net, providing an understanding environment sometimes characterised as a 'bad trips' tent.\nThe 7-7-77 Glastonbury Free Festival was organised by BIT, including activist Alan Strom.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nBeam, Alan; Morrison, Pete (1976).

      "title": "Blue Peter badge",
      "content": "A Blue Peter badge is an award for Blue Peter viewers, given by the BBC children's television programme for those appearing on the show, or in recognition of achievement. They are awarded to children aged 5 to 15, or to adults who have been guests on the programme. Adults can also get a Gold badge if they have done something extraordinary. Approximately 22,000 are distributed annually.\nThe pin badges were introduced to the programme by editor Biddy Baxter in 1963, from an idea by Blue Peter producer Edward Barnes. The design, a shield containing the Blue Peter ship logo, was designed by Tony Hart. Coincidentally, Hart's plasticine companion, Morph, was awarded one in 1981 by Blue Peter presenter at the time Sarah Greene. Although the original white-and-blue design remains the most common and well-known, differently coloured variations have been created for various purposes. Gold badges are the highest level of award, being reserved for exceptional achievements and former presenters.\nThe badge provides the wearer with free entry to many British attractions, particularly museums and exhibitions that are featured on the show, although many of the attractions will only allow one badge holder for each full price paying adult. The programme producers suspended the privileges amid concerns about the badges being sold in March 2006, but they were reintroduced with additional security a few months later.\n\n\n== Use by presenters ==\nThe presenters almost always wear their badges on the show – the only exception being when their apparel is incompatible (for example, a life jacket), in which case a sticker with the ship emblem is normally used instead. In addition, large prints or stickers of the ship are attached to vehicles driven by the presenters during filming assignments.\nSometimes new presenters first appear on the programme with no badge before it is clarified to the audience that they are a new presenter. For example, Zöe Salmon appeared on the show as a guest a week before being introduced as a presenter. Simon Groom first appeared during a filming assignment at a disco where he was a DJ and Gethin Jones made a debut appearance disguised as Santa Claus on Zoe Salmon's first appearance.\nMany presenters are awarded the more prestigious \"gold badge\" when they leave the show. When Simon Thomas left in 2005, he was awarded a gold badge on his last programme. This has since become a tradition with Liz Barker, Matt Baker, Konnie Huq, Katy Hill, Joel Defries, Andy Akinwolere, Helen Skelton, Lindsey Russell, Adam Beales and Barney Harwood also being awarded gold badges on their final show. Conversely, when Richard Bacon was fired from the show for drug use, he was required to hand back his Blue Peter badge.\nSeveral former presenters have been awarded them when appearing as guests on the programme. Valerie Singleton was awarded a gold badge during a studio interview recorded for the 1990 video release The Best of Blue Peter, the 60's and 70's. Her fellow presenters John Noakes and Peter Purves were given gold badges on the first programme in 2000 when the time capsule for the year 2000 was dug up. Peter Duncan was presented with a gold badge in February 2007, whilst appearing on the programme as a guest.\n\n\n== Awards to viewers ==\nBlue Peter badges are frequently given out to children who appear on the show. Additionally, viewers aged 6–15 can apply for a badge by corresponding with the show by post. Applications require a message of at least 50 words explaining why a badge is deserved and often include drawings, poems, or other creative works. There are different types of badges, representing different types of achievement.\n\n\n== History of badges ==\nThe badge was originally introduced in 1963, featuring the blue ship logo on a white plastic shield inspired by the ship from Disney's Peter Pan. This design remained unchanged until the 1990s when a revised badge featuring a raised moulding of the ship design by Tony Hart was introduced (more detailed and neater than the previous printed reproduction). This version disappeared in 1997 when the old-style badge returned.\nIn 2004, coinciding with the show's September revamp, a new badge design was introduced. It is slightly larger in dimension and with a much bolder printing of the new-style traditional ship without its rigging detail (though the pre-2000 style flags remain).\nIn 2016, it was announced that any future Green badges awarded (see below) would be made out of recycled yoghurt pots to try to make them 'greener'. The Blue and Purple badges followed suit during early 2017. These badges are slightly smaller, thinner and lighter than the badges before this change, but have the same ship design as the 2004 badge.\n\n\n== Types ==\nBlue Peter currently awards several different types of badges, as well as, occasionally, some limited edition variants.\n\n\n=== Main badges ===\n\nThe Blue or White badge (a blue ship on a white shield): This is what the presenters on the show usually wear. Viewers of the programme can win one by either sending in an interesting letter, poem, picture or story, or by appearing on the programme.\nThe Green badge (a white ship on a green shield): This is Blue Peter's environmental award, awarded for any correspondence from viewers with a conservation, nature or environmental theme. Presenters on the programme occasionally wear this badge instead of the blue one, as does the gardener Chris Collins, and they have been given out to those appearing on editions of the programme dedicated to environmental issues. On the Thursday 2 June 2016 show, it was announced that the Green badge would be made out of recycled material from then onwards.\nThe Orange, or Competition Winners badge (a white ship on an orange shield): This is given to viewers who have been either a winner or runner-up in any of Blue Peter's many competitions. This replaced the original competition winners badge, which was a circular metal badge with the ship in the centre and the words \"Blue Peter Competition Winner\" around the outside, in 2005.\nThe Sport badge was first introduced for a limited time in 2013, to try to get more children to participate in sport (from the months of July to September – a child's usual summer holiday). The badge is shield-shaped and is made from the same material as the common Blue badge. It was originally a white badge with a medal shape on the front of it (the round-shaped medal was blue, but had the white Blue Peter ship on it. The ribbon 'attached' to the medal was made from stripes of blue, white and red). A child could earn this version of the badge by introducing someone to a new sport (maybe a friend or a brother or sister). Children could initially apply for the Sport badge during the summer months of every year since 2013, with slight changes in the badge's design each year. The 2014 and 2015 badge had borders added to the design, which were blue and red respectively. To celebrate the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, a competition was launched to design the 2016 Sport badge. The Sport badge was also awarded in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The 2021/22 Sport badge was designed by skateboarder Sky Brown; it featured a wave design, and the raised motto, \"The Sky is the Limit,\" in a ring around the ship logo. The current version of the Sport badge (launched on 14 July 2023) was designed by England footballer Leah Williamson. This badge is now available all year round, and is awarded to children for trying a new sport or for showing progress in a particular sport or physical activity.\nThe Music badge, designed by Ed Sheeran, was launched for BBC Music Day in 2019; it has a black ship on a multi-coloured shield featuring musical instruments and other motifs.\nThe Book badge was introduced in 2023. It is awarded to children for showing an interest in reading. It was designed by Sir Quentin Blake in his caricature style.\nThe Gold badge (a gold-plated brooch in the shape of the ship logo): This is Blue Peter's highest award and is given for exceptional achievement, such as to people who have performed acts of extreme bravery, or represented their country in a major event. It takes the form of a gold-plated ship-shaped pin brooch. Gold badge holders include Leo Stuchbury (1993) who was awarded this badge for being the youngest ever person to complete the National Swimathon at the age of 6, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, Stephen Payne, Queen Elizabeth II (2001), Tom Daley (2009), David Tennant (2009), Sir Lewis Hamilton (2009), Karina Bailey McNally (2009), Dani Harmer (2009), Anthony Horowitz (2011), Sir Jonathan Ive (2013), Helen Glover (2014), Peter Lord (2015), Steven Spielberg (2016), Roald Dahl (posthumously 2016), the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (2017), Ed Sheeran (2018), Madonna, Sir Peter Jackson, Sir David Attenborough, Sir Paul McCartney (2019), Captain Tom Moore (2020), Anne Wood (2020), Marcus Rashford (2021), and King Charles III and Queen Camilla (2023). Also, Matthew McGuinness for outstanding cricket despite living with cystic fibrosis in 2006, E Henshaw for fundraising efforts in 2013 and Emily Burrows for bravery and fundraising in 2019. Two dogs have also received the Gold badge: Bonnie in 1991 and Endal in 2003. Valerie Singleton was the first former presenter to be awarded the gold badge, being presented with it by Yvette Fielding and John Leslie during the recording of a commercial VHS home video The Best of Blue Peter, the 60's and 70's, released in 1990. John Noakes and Peter Purves were awarded their gold badges during the programme broadcast in January 2000 where the presenters reunited to open the box buried for the millennium in 1971. It has become traditional to present a leaving presenter with a gold badge on their final show, firstly with Simon Thomas, (see Use by presenters, above). Former editors of the programme; Biddy Baxter and Lewis Bronze were both given the badge live on their last shows, whilst Richard Marson was awarded one after his last programme by Baxter. Janet Ellis was awarded her gold badge in November 2017 on BBC’s breakfast news by presenter Radzi Chingyanganya.\n\n\n=== Limited edition badges ===\nAs well as the badges listed above, some types of badges have been produced as limited editions for various occasions:\n\nA 25th birthday badge, introduced in October 1983.\nA 30th birthday badge, introduced in October 1988.\nA 35th birthday badge, introduced in October 1993.\nA badge to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the launch of the original badge in 1963, introduced in October 2003. This moulding was made of rubber and larger than the traditional badge; it consisted of a white shield with a raised 'bubble ship' applique.\nA 50th birthday badge, introduced in October 2008. This was a gold shield with a blue ship, with the digits \"50\" superimposed. It was awarded to viewers who sent in something to the programme which celebrated the 50th birthday. However this badge was not announced on the programme itself.\nThe Factbyte Factory badge (a shield containing a hologram which oscillates between the Blue Peter logo and a \"factbyte\" logo) was introduced in early 2009. This badge was awarded to those achieving VIP Level 7 in the online Factbyte Factory game. This was achieved by collecting factbytes (interesting facts and information represented by a gold circle containing an f) from the programmes and the website. This was a limited-edition badge and the promotion ended after the close of the 2009 series.\nThe Diamond badge, given out in 2018 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Blue Peter and given to viewers who had already received a blue badge.\nThe Doctor Who badge, given out in 2023 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who, was given to the top 500 competition entries for the Blue Peter Doctor Who Competition.\nThe Silver and Blue badge (a silver ship on a blue shield; not to be confused with the Silver badge described below) was awarded to viewers who had already won a Blue badge, for a further achievement, until it was retired in 2022 in favour of a new Silver badge.\nThe Silver badge (a silver ship on a sparkling silver shield) was launched on 14 October 2022, and was awarded for acts of kindness and supporting others. This badge was retired on 10 February 2025.\nThe Purple, Fan Club or Team Player's badge (a white ship on a purple shield): Introduced in September 2006, this was originally awarded to twelve children a month who won the chance to spend a day working with the Blue Peter team by having ideas for the programme. It was also awarded to the 'Purple Lady' visited by Gethin Jones on the show broadcast on Thursday 10 May 2007. From the September 2007 series, the 'team players' scheme was changed and viewers were then awarded these badges when writing a review of an edition of the programme. Applications for the Purple badge closed on 31 March 2025.\n\n\n=== Other awards ===\nAs well as the badges, an \"Outstanding Endeavour\" award was introduced to the show in 1978. It is circular, made from brass, and bears the show's ship logo. It was presented to the programme on its 20th-anniversary show by original presenter Christopher Trace. Trace was working at a factory at the time and his colleagues made the award to be presented to a viewer who had achieved some remarkable endeavour, such as saving a life or overcoming a particular adversity. Trace had not informed the production team ahead of the live broadcast he was planning on introducing the award on the programme. Initially it was presented annually on the show's October birthday edition, being given to, amongst others, pop group Musical Youth in 1982 and trampoline champion Andrea Holmes in 1983, who received the award from Trace himself on the 25th-anniversary show. 11-years-old lifesaver Martin Pout won the award in 1984 followed by Bob Geldof in 1985. Don Allum took the award in 1987 and teenagers Simon Marsh and Anthony Walters were recognised in 1988 for saving a school bus from disaster, being given their award by Valerie Singleton on the show's 30th anniversary edition. In 1989 the show honoured the boys of Emanuel School who had assisted the victims of the Clapham Junction rail crash on 12 December 1988 This was the last time the award was presented.\n\n\n== Badges for sale ==\nIn March 2006, the news that Blue Peter badges were available for sale on auction websites such as eBay attracted a great deal of media interest, with the suspicion that the right to free entry was being abused. In a leader article The Times described the news as \"a knife to the national psyche\", while The Sun launched a campaign in which readers could \"send in the names of people they know who have an illegal Blue Peter badge\".\nAfter news of the sales reached a wide audience, the number of badges for sale on eBay exploded from a few dozen to 300. eBay said that it would remove any auctions proven to involve fake badges on the grounds of copyright infringement, but that trade in real badges was not illegal and would not be halted by eBay administrators.\nOn 29 March 2006, the decision was made to withdraw the privileges the badges offered until measures could be put in place to stop the badges being sold for commercial gain, with the show appealing to the public for ideas. Accompanying the statement of suspensions the show's editor Richard Marson said Blue Peter wished to \"protect children who have earned their badges and who are feeling very let down by this cynical trade.\"\nBlue Peter badges were re-introduced on 19 June 2006, under a new system in which all current holders of a Blue Peter badge and those who win a badge will also need to be issued with a photo ID card. The idea was thought up by 11-year-old Blue Peter viewer and Blue badge winner Helen Jennings, who even included a prototype design of the ID card in the letter that she sent to the show. The producers awarded Jennings a Silver badge for proposing the system. ID cards for previous badge winners aged 6 to 15 can be obtained by entering details into a form on the Blue Peter website.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCBBC – Blue Peter badges\nBBC News story about sale of Blue Peter badges on eBay\nThe Register covers the Blue Peter ID card scheme",

      "content": "In the UK, the body piercing industry is largely unregulated. Tattooing and body piercing studios must be licensed but there are no national standards to reduce health risks or specific requirements for professional competence, leading to concerns over infection and proper practice.\n\n\n== Laws and guidelines ==\nUnlike tattoos, there is no minimum age for most piercings in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, people must be over 18 to have their genitals pierced (including female nipples). In Scotland, under-16s must have a parent or guardian's assistance and the parent or guardian must be present during the piercing. In Wales, it is an offence to pierce or arrange to pierce the tongue, genitals or nipples of under-18s.\nIn 2013, a tattooing and piercing guidance toolkit was released, aiming to promote national safety and consistency across the industry by informing local authorities and businesses about good standards of practice. This toolkit was endorsed by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH), Public Health England (PHE), the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), and the Tattoo and Piercing Industry Union (TPIU). It addressed health concerns such as the risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses.\n\n\n== Considered regulation ==\nWales is the only UK country planning a compulsory licensing scheme for tattoo parlours and piercing studios. The legislative work for this scheme was due to be brought in during 2020, but the scheme was delayed by Brexit and the Covid pandemic. Under this legislation, technicians who have a poor history of infection would be prevented from moving counties and setting up new businesses.\nIn 2011, the Welsh government proposed that under-16s should not be allowed to have cosmetic piercings without their parents' permission; however, this was not implemented.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Brexit in popular culture",
      "content": "Brexit is the commonly used term for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union on 31 January 2020, which resulted from a referendum on 23 June 2016. This article details the mostly critical response to this decision in the visual art, novels, theatre, and film.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe British government led by David Cameron held a referendum on the issue in 2016; a majority voted to leave the European Union. On 29 March 2017, Theresa May's administration invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union in a letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The UK was set to leave on 29 March 2019, unless the Brexit Withdrawal agreement was adopted by the House of Commons, in which case the UK would have left in May 2019. With the failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement by the British Parliament, Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated a further extension until 31 October 2019. Later that year the withdrawal was delayed a further 3 months  and, struggling to pass his renegotiated deal in the way he wished, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the 2019 general election on 12 December 2019. The election resulted in the Conservatives receiving a majority of 80 seats; the UK subsequently left the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020.\n\n\n== Artists' sentiments toward Brexit ==\n\nThe response of artists and writers to Brexit has tended to be negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain's creative industries voting against leaving the European Union. The visual artist Bob and Roberta Smith, writing in The Guardian newspaper during 2017, typifies this response:\n\nPost-Brexit, we face a dissolution of our museums and galleries comparable in its devastation to that visited on England in the 1530s, as philistine politicians slash budgets. Art schools and the arts in schools will be further diminished in a wave of manufactured disdain for so-called elitists.\nGilbert and George, Morrissey, Roger Daltrey and Ringo Starr are among the creative figures who support Brexit.\n\n\n== Brexit in the visual arts ==\nResponses by visual artists to Brexit include a mural, painted in May 2017, by the secretive graffiti artist Banksy near the ferry port at Dover in southern England. It shows a workman using a chisel to chip off one of the stars on the European Union Flag. In August 2019 the mural was found to have been painted over with white paint and covered in scaffolding.\nIn his 2017 art exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London, the artist Grayson Perry showed a series of ceramic, tapestry and other works of art dealing with the divisions in Britain during the Brexit campaign and in its aftermath. This included two large ceramic pots, Perry called his Brexit Vases, standing on plinths ten feet apart, on the first of which were scenes involving pro-European British citizens, and on the second scenes involving anti-European British citizens. These were derived from what Perry called his 'Brexit tour of Britain'.\nIn 2019, The Guardian commissioned Anish Kapoor to create a piece of art in response to the political climate around Brexit. Kapoor's work, entitled A Brexit, A Broxit, We All Fall Down, was an image of Britain with \"a gory rip stretching from Glasgow to the south coast\".\nJason deCaires Taylor installed an artwork called Pride of Brexit at the base of the White Cliffs of Dover in 2019. It consisted of three lions, a national symbol, \"emaciated and exhausted\" lying on the sand. Taylor said they were meant to be \"a monument to one of the most unpatriotic events Britain has ever seen\". They were later reinstalled on the Thames embankment across from the Palace of Westminster.\nArtist Clemens Wilhelm was commissioned by Scottish arts organisation Deveron Projects to mark the departure of the UK from the EU. His weeping willow Brexit Tree would be planted on the day the UK left the EU as a \"symbol of loss and healing\". It was planted on 31 January 2020 in a ceremony that included participation of Richard Demarco and A. L. Kennedy. A film work of the project will be released in January 2021.\n\n\n== Brexit in novels ==\nThe day after the referendum, gay niche erotica author Chuck Tingle self-published the 4,000-word book Pounded by the Pound: Turned Gay by the Socioeconomic Implications of Britain Leaving the European Union, in which a large coin from the future comes to see the main character Alex to explain him the danger of Brexit, and together they go back to the past to sway voters against voting to leave the European Union, \"proving that all you need is love.\"\nPeter Preston's 1998 novel, The 51st State, predicted a UK Prime Minister, following his father's dying wishes, withdrawing the UK from the EU, then joining the United States.\nAli Smith's 2016 novel Autumn has been described by the Financial Times as the first serious Brexit novel.\nOne of the first novels to engage with a post-Brexit Britain was Rabbitman by Michael Paraskos (published 9 March 2017). Rabbitman is a dark comic fantasy in which the events that lead to the election of a right-wing populist American president, and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, were the result of a series of Faustian pacts with the Devil. As a result, Rabbitman is set partly in a post-Brexit Britain in which society has collapsed and people are dependent on European Union food aid.\nMark Billingham's Love Like Blood (published 1 June 2017) is a crime thriller in which Brexit sees a rise in xenophobic hate crime. In the novel The Remains of the Way (published 6 June 2017), David Boyle imagines Brexit was a conspiracy led by a forgotten government quango, still working away in Whitehall, originally set up by Thomas Cromwell in the 16th century during the reign of King Henry VIII, and now dedicated to a Protestant Brexit.\nPost-Brexit Britain is also the setting for Amanda Craig's The Lie of the Land (published 13 June 2017), a satirical novel set ten years after the vote to leave the European Union, in which an impoverished middle class couple from Islington in north London are forced to move from the heart of the pro-European Union capital to the heart of the pro-Brexit countryside in Devon.\nBrexit is also the baseline for Douglas Board's comic political thriller Time of Lies (published 23 June 2017). In this novel, the first post-Brexit general election in 2020 is won by a violent right-wing former football hooligan called Bob Grant. Board charts the response to this of the hitherto pro-European Union metropolitan political elite.\nStanley Johnson's Kompromat (published 23 July 2017) is a political thriller that suggests the vote to leave the European Union was a result of Russian influence on the referendum, although Johnson has insisted his book is not intended to point the finger at Russia's secret services, but is \"just meant to be fun\".\nJonathan Coe's Middle England (published 8 November 2018) is a state-of-the-nation novel which re-introduces some of the author's earlier characters from The Rotters' Club (2001) and The Closed Circle (2004), and moves from the election of the coalition government in 2010, through the riots of 2011, the 2012 Olympics,  the 2016 referendum and its aftermath, ending in 2018.\nNight of the Party by Tracey Mathias is set in the UK after Brexit. With a far-right party in power, only British-born people are permitted to remain in the country, and the book examines the consequences of populist and isolationist policies on the protagonist and his friends.\nRachel Churcher's Battle Ground series is Young Adult dystopia, set in a totalitarian near-future UK after Brexit and Scottish independence.\nSam Byers' Perfidious Albion is set in East Anglia, and examines power, influence, and nationalism in the UK after Brexit.\nChris Mullin's The Friends of Harry Perkins, the sequel to A Very British Coup, is set in the aftermath of Brexit, said to be neither apocalyptic nor an economic miracle. It follows Fred Thompson's journey to becoming Labour leader and eventually Prime Minister, with one of his chief aims being to reverse Brexit.\n\n\n== Brexit in theatre ==\nIn theatre, in June 2017 the National Theatre in London presented a play by Carol Ann Duffy, entitled, My Country; a work in progress. An allegorical work, the play uses the device of a convention called by the goddess Britannia who is concerned about the future of the British people. The play differs from some artistic responses in that Duffy and the National Theatre-based the attitudes of the characters on stage in part on the responses to interviews, conducted by the regional offices of the UK Arts Councils, with ordinary people, but excluding responses from London and the south-east of England, where most people voted not to leave the European Union. As a result, according to Dominic Cavendish, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, \"the bias is towards the Leave camp\".\nHowever the play, that only featured British voices, was an example of how the British theatre artists largely ignored the perspective of migrants, contributing to “the paradox of simultaneous hyper- and in-visibility of immigrants in the UK” in the Brexit debate. Much more interesting were contributions from the UK-based migrant artists “in which migrant artists claim[ed] agency over their representation within public spaces and create a platform for a new social imagination that can facilitate transnational and trans-local encounters, multicultural democratic spaces, sense of commonality, and solidarity.\"\nRosaura (an adaptation of Life Is a Dream by Pedro Calderón de la Barca) created by actors Paula Rodríguez and Sandra Arpa was performed in London just after the Brexit referendum. It reimagines Calderón's story by focusing on Rosaura, and changes several details in the play (including adding references to Brexit). Moscow (where Rosaura is from) is changed to 'Hispania' and the Polish royal court is changed to the 'Court of Europe'. Instead of Astolfo and Segismundo battling, they compete in a \"reality show-style election\" where Astolfo is characterised as similar to Boris Johnson. \nAn Evening with an Immigrant is an autobiographical piece by a British-based Nigerian poet and performer Inua Ellams. It premiered in July 2016 at the Soho Theatre in London. Ellams recalls his life between Nigeria, the UK, and Ireland and comments on the British colonial past and its role in the current migrant crisis. Bubble Revolution by Polish playwright Julia Holewińska, directed by John Currivan and co-created and performed by Kasia Lech at the 2016 Edinburgh Fringe Festival focused on growing-up in communist and post-communist Poland and experiences of speaking English as a foreign language. The three productions used “memories rooted in their native and non-native cultures as a platform for the audience to engage with transnational conditions in today's Europe and the UK, and explore these and spectators’ own experiences through a translocal gaze”.\n\n\n== Brexit in film and television ==\nIn 2016, the television director Martin Durkin wrote and directed an 81-minute long documentary film titled Brexit: The Movie, which advocated with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The film was produced by the production company Wag TV with a budget of £300,000. The production costs were sourced primarily through crowdfunding via Kickstarter alongside a £50,000 contribution from the hedge fund Spitfire Capital. In May 2016, the film premiered in Leicester Square, with notable figures such as Nigel Farage and David Davis (who later became Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union) in attendance.\nA documentary film was released in 2018, called Postcards from the 48%, which is described on the film's website as: \"A documentary film made by and featuring those who voted Remain, the 48%, to show the other 27 EU Member States that it was far from a landslide victory and just why we are fighting to stay part of the EU\". A review on Shadows on the Wall called it \"a comprehensive, factual exploration of the issue, grappling with the referendum, its ramifications and the way the split vote has fractured British society.\"\nA two-hour television drama film written by James Graham and directed by Toby Haynes, named Brexit: The Uncivil War (simply Brexit in the US), was released in January 2019. It depicts the lead-up to the 2016 referendum through the activities of the strategists behind the Vote Leave campaign, that prompted the United Kingdom to exit the European Union. It aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on 7 January, and aired on HBO in the United States on 19 January. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Dominic Cummings, the Campaign Director of the official designated Brexit-supporting group, Vote Leave.\nThe TV series Years and Years (2019) also reflects post-Brexit dystopian society focused on the Manchester-based Lyons family.\n\n\n== Brexit in video games ==\nIn the football management simulation Football Manager 2017 and its successor Football Manager 2018, Brexit is an event within the game. There are multiple possible outcomes decided by chance reflecting both a soft Brexit and a hard Brexit. Consequences of a hard Brexit are, among others, EU football players needing a working visa to play in English teams.\nNot Tonight is a role-playing game set in an alternate timeline shortly after Brexit. The player takes the role of a European-born immigrant who must survive under a far-right British government to avoid deportation.\nWatch Dogs: Legion is an action adventure game set in a post-Brexit dystopian London, with Britain having become a surveillance state under Albion.\nPokémon Sword & Shield is set in a region inspired by the United Kingdom. When it was announced that a number of Pokémon introduced in previous games would be unobtainable in this entry, fans began protesting the decision and referred to it as \"Dexit\".\n\n\n== Brexit on social media ==\nArguably, nowhere exhibited a greater display of opinion surrounding Brexit than online social media platforms. Social media had a significant short-term influence on the referendum result and supports the argument that Brexit was not inevitable but was in fact a response to a multitude of influences and events in the build-up. For example, a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that fake Twitter accounts could have added 1.76% in the pro-leave voting share.\nIn 2018, an anonymous Twitter account called @BorderIrish gained notability tweeting as the Irish border in the first person, and the implications that Brexit would have for it.\n\n\n== Brexit in music ==\nThe 2016 track \"Hey Kids (Bumaye)\" by American rap duo Run the Jewels features the line \"Run the Jewels'll make last breaths Brexit\".\nBilly Bragg's 2017 album Bridges Not Walls contains several references to Brexit, both overt and more subtle. The opening track \"The Sleep of Reason\" includes the lyrics \"Lies ride in style on a big red bus\", referring to the Vote Leave campaign bus. Track 5 on the album (\"Not Everything that Counts Can Be Counted\") contains the verse: \n\nPeople have had enough of experts\nAnd their inconvenient facts\nHere's what the media really won't tell ya\n\nExactly who it is that's taking control back\nThis is a reference to Michael Gove's comments regarding experts. The sixth track \"Full English Brexit\", is described on Genius.com as \"a satirical song from the perspective of an English person talking themselves into Brexit\".\nIn November 2018, The Good, the Bad & the Queen released Merrie Land, which reflects on the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union and being British during the prelude to Brexit. The lyrics are complemented by the loping basslines, sparse guitar, and intricate drumming, which contribute to the overall dark sonic ambience of the album.\nThe Breunion Boys are a Dutch boy band created by artist Julia Veldman in response to Brexit. The group's debut song, \"Britain Come Back\" was released in December 2018.\nIn October 2019, along with a group of musicians calling themselves Article 54, the journalist and musician Rhodri Marsden released The Hustle, an eight track concept disco symphony album with tracks inspired by the UK's Brexit negotiations. Tracks from the album were debuted on the 10 October edition of the BBC One political programme Brexitcast. It then appeared on the iTunes UK Album Chart, where it quickly began to outsell ABBA Gold. The album appeared on the Official UK Charts on 18 October, debuting at number 56 on the download chart.\nIn March 2020, Riz Ahmed — the popular actor and one half of the rap duo Swet Shop Boys — released his first solo album, The Long Goodbye. It has been described as a \"concept album that reframes the UK's relationship with British Asians as a \"toxic and abusive\" love affair that has reached its breaking point in the wake of Brexit and the rise of the far-right.\" It is the quintessential break-up album—except that the breakup baggage is \"the weight of colonial trauma\" and that the ex-girlfriend Britney stands in for \"Britannia\".\n\n\n== Brexit in food and drink ==\nBrexitovka, also known as the Brexit Vodka, is a premium craft British vodka from Norfolk in England which commemorates Brexit. It is the first brand of spirit to explicitly commemorate Brexit. Brexitovka was launched by an Anglo-Polish eurosceptic Przemek de Skuba Skwirczynski at the February 2017 UKIP conference with the slogan \"Celebrate Brexit in style or drown your sorrows with Brexitovka\". The company was struck off the Companies House register in April 2018, before the UK left the EU.\nIn October 2020, the 'Brexit Biscuit', shortbread with a half-EU flag, half-Union Jack design, was launched. It came in a wrapper printed with the text of Article 50 and were meant to be snappable.\n\n\n== Brexit in commemorative stamps ==\nIn 2018, Boris Johnson sparked governmental outrage by backing calls to introduce a commemorative Brexit stamp. The Postal Services Minister Margot James branded the proposed commemorative stamps as 'divisive'. Johnson told The Sun: \"Leaving the European Union will be a monumental moment in British history, so let's deliver a commemorative stamp that shows the world we've got Brexit licked\". Royal Mail issued a statement saying that it \"does not intend to issue a stamp to mark the UK's exit from the EU\". Conservative MP Nigel Evans criticised the company for \"playing politics\".\nAustria's post service printed 140,000 commemorative stamps to mark the event of Britain's departure from the European Union. However, the commemorative stamps had to be reprinted due to changes to the official date for exit.\n\n\n== Use in the dictionary ==\nThe noun Brexit was added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in 2016, which identified it as originating among economists in 2012. A senior editor said it had become widely used with \"impressive\" speed, having proved itself more popular than \"Brixit\", or the more accurate \"UKexit\". The editor added: \"Brexit's inclusion in the OED December update within five years of being coined is highly unusual... by late 2016 it was a global word.\" Other variations began to appear such as Brexiteer, and brexit as a verb.\nIn October 2019, Académie Goncourt chairman Bernard Pivot tweeted (in translation): \"I propose to insert the word 'brexit' (without capital letter) into the French language. It will indicate a cacophonous and insoluble debate, a bloody shambolic reunion or assembly. Example: the meeting of the joint owners ended in brexit.\" (The inclusion of the British expletive is supported two-fold by the Collins-Robert French Dictionary.)\n\n\n== References ==",

      "content": "In film, television, and radio, British comedy has produced some of the most renowned characters in the world. In it, satire is one of the features of British comedy. Radio comedy in Britain has been almost exclusively hosted on the BBC.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBritish comedy history is measured in centuries. Shakespeare incorporated many chase scenes and beatings into his comedies, such as in his play The Comedy of Errors. Punch and Judy made their first recorded appearance in Britain in 1662, when Samuel Pepys noted a \"pretty\" puppet play being performed in Covent Garden, London. The various episodes of Punch and Judy are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch.\nSatire has been a major feature of comedy in the British Isles for centuries. The pictorial satire of William Hogarth was a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th-century Britain The medium developed under the direction of James Gillray from London, who has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.\nIn early 19th-century Britain, pantomime acquired its present form, which includes slapstick comedy and featured the first mainstream clown, Joseph Grimaldi, while comedy routines also featured heavily in British music hall theatre which became popular in the 1850s. British comedians who honed their skills at pantomime and music hall sketches include Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, George Formby, and Dan Leno. The music hall comedian and theatre impresario Fred Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s, and Chaplin and Laurel were among the young comedians who worked for him as part of \"Fred Karno's Army\".\n\n\n== Theatre ==\n\n\n== Film comedy ==\n\n\n== Radio ==\nRadio comedy in Britain has been almost exclusively the preserve of the BBC. In the 1940s and 1950s, variety dominated the schedules, and popular series included It's That Man Again and Much Binding in the Marsh. In the 1950s, the BBC was running Hancock's Half Hour starring Tony Hancock. Hancock's Half Hour was later transferred to television.\nOne of the notable radio shows was the double entendre-laden Round the Horne (1965–1968), a sequel to the earlier series Beyond Our Ken, which ran from 1959 to 1964.\nLater radio shows made use of the panel game format, including the long-running Just a Minute (1967–), I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue (1972–), and The News Quiz (1977–), which often broadcast a dozen of so episodes a year.\n\n\n== Television ==\nFollowing the success of Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe and Son, sitcoms became a part of some television schedules. The BBC has generally been dominant in television comedy, but the commercial stations have also had some successes. Other formats have also been popular, such as with sketch shows, stand-up comedy, impressionists, and puppet shows.\nNotable satirical comedies are the 1960s series That Was The Week That Was, the 1980s series Not the Nine O'Clock News, and ITV's puppet show Spitting Image. The show of the 1980s and early 1990s, Spitting Image, was a satire of politics, entertainment, sport, and British culture of the era, and at its peak, it was watched by 15 million people. British satire has also gone over into quiz shows; popular examples include the news quiz Have I Got News for You, 8 out of 10 cats, and Shooting Stars.\nIn the 1980s, alternative comedy was spearheaded by Ben Elton and The Comic Strip group, which included Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall, and French and Saunders. The 1990s and 2000s also have those that have used editing, surreal humour, and cultural references to great effect.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBritish Comedy Guide\nList of British comedians\nBritish Comedy Awards\nBritish humour\nBritish sitcom\nList of U.K. game shows\nList of BBC sitcoms\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

      "title": "British country clothing",
      "content": "British country clothing or English country clothing is a style, or fashion genre, which has its roots in the traditional attire worn in rural areas of the United Kingdom. It is heavily influenced by traditional country sports, such as equestrian pursuits, shooting or fishing and  general outdoor activity, such as walking, picnicking, or gardening. \nAlthough often associated with the archetypal image of an English country lady or gentleman, the style is worn throughout the United Kingdom and draws on traditions and materials from across the British Isles. Scottish tweeds, Welsh woollens, and Irish linens all play a significant role in shaping its character. \nWhile still considered countryside leisure wear, due to durability, practicality, comfort and fashionable style, some people choose to use elements of British country clothing for general usage. It is also a popular choice at events such as horse races, country weddings, beer festivals and country fairs.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, what is regarded as traditional country clothing was a popular choice for wealthy people living in the British countryside as well as those who travelled there for leisure. Members of the British upper classes would go to the countryside for sporting events organised by the owners of English country houses if they did not own a country house themselves, and therefore they required practical and durable clothing. Today many of the original tailors who produced some of the first country-style clothing still exist, and some have been granted a royal warrant. Where it was once basic and usually just worn in the country, the popularity of the style has led to productions on the high street, as well as variations in the colours used as opposed to just natural. \nMany elements of British country clothing have even been used by designers to develop styles which are suitable for everyday wear; today people also choose to use elements of country clothing mixed with modern designs, such as a tweed jacket with denim trousers. It has also been influential in the development of preppy and Ivy League styles of dress in the United States and Canada.\n\n\n== Country attire ==\n\n\n=== Headwear ===\nThe flat cap, Irish walking hat, deerstalker and trilby hat are some traditional forms of headwear used in the country. The flat cap is often made of tweed or cotton, whilst a trilby is traditionally made from felt material. A feather pinned to the side of a trilby is a traditional accessory for both men and women, and can also optionally be attached to a jacket lapel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Footwear ===\nFootwear usually depends on the activity in which the wearer is taking part, the weather and conditions underfoot, and the social circumstances. Some of the most common forms of footwear are natural rubber Wellington boots and leather country boots which protect the wearer from mud and water on the ground. When wearing a tweed suit, leather brogues are usually a choice of footwear; however, this also depends on the activity or event.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Jackets and coats ===\n\nEnglish country jackets usually include waxed and quilted jackets. The traditional style is dark olive green with a brown corduroy collar which is based on the original colour palette used when they were first produced, which also included navy as opposed to dark olive green. A gilet is also a popular style of country jacket. Tweed jackets and coats are also worn to protect against weather due to the durability of the material. Fleece jackets and gilets have also become part of country attire in Britain.\n\n\n=== Tweed suits and sports jackets ===\nThe material tweed has long been associated with the British countryside; when Prince Albert purchased the Balmoral estate he designed the Balmoral tweed long before he laid the first bricks of Balmoral Castle. Tweed uses natural colours to blend into the natural environment; Prince Albert designed the Balmoral Tweed to resemble the granite mountains of Aberdeenshire for stalking. Original country styles include a Norfolk jacket and tweed breeks.\nTweed suits, normally consisting of a jacket, waistcoat and trousers (or skirt) have been an icon of the English country gentleman and lady since the 1840s when Catherine, Lady Dunmore began to provide for the British aristocracy and landed gentry; it soon proved popular as it provided a practical but also smart-casual style. Today tweed suits remain popular, with some choosing the style for business as well as pleasure. However, people very rarely wear the full three piece when outdoors, usually only at events; the suit is traditionally worn with a Tattersall or Gingham shirt and optionally a tie or neck scarf for women. Some also choose to wear a knitwear sweater or jumper for warmth and to remain casual. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe popularity of country clothing surges periodically as a result of television period dramas such as Downton Abbey and the earlier All Creatures Great and Small, plus frequent photography releases of celebrities featured wearing the country style. This has included members of the British royal family, such as King Charles III, who wear traditional British country clothing when attending racing events and when at royal estates such as Balmoral and Highgrove. The boost in popularity has led to modernised variations of country clothing being produced to attract younger consumers; such designs, such as those by Dolce & Gabbana, have even taken inspiration from Queen Elizabeth II. Other designers, such as Ralph Lauren, have stated their love for country clothing and have based some of their designs on the style. In 2006, retailers in New York reported a boom in demand for the waxed country jacket featured by Dame Helen Mirren in her portrayal of Elizabeth II in The Queen (2006).\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nEnglish country clothing has featured in many media works, usually when scenes are filmed in the countryside or in an English garden.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Queen (2006)\nWhat a Girl Wants (2003)\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nElly Griffiths' Ruth Galloway series, especially The Ghost Fields (2014)\n\n\n=== Television ===\nCountryfile\nSpring, Autumn and Winterwatch\nDownton Abbey\nThe Fast Show (Ted and Ralph)\nLast of the Summer Wine\nThe Vicar of Dibley\nTo The Manor Born\nThe Crown\nAll Creatures Great and Small\n\n\n== See also ==\nTracht – Worn in Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol\nTeba jacket – Worn in Great Britain, Spain, France and Austria\nSloane Ranger\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "British diaspora",
      "content": "The British diaspora consists of people of English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, Cornish, Manx and Channel Islands ancestral descent who live outside of the United Kingdom and its Crown Dependencies.\nIn 2008, the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office estimated that at least 80% of New Zealanders had some British ancestry, however at the 2018 census only 70% of New Zealanders identified as having some European ancestry. Up to 76% of Australians, 48% of Canadians, 33% of Americans, and 3% of South Africans have ancestry from the British Isles. Additionally, at least 270,000 Argentines have some British ancestry. More than 300,000 Anglo-Indians have some British ancestry, but comprise less than 0.1% of India's population.\nThe British diaspora includes about 200 million people worldwide. Other countries with over 100,000 British expatriates include the Republic of Ireland, Spain, France, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n== History of British diaspora ==\n\n\n=== Up to the 19th century ===\nThe first documented exodus of Britons began during the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Great Britain. A large number of Brythonic-speaking Celts fled or migrated to what is now Brittany on the coast of France, becoming the Bretons.\nThe second large-scale British migration came following the Norman Conquest of England, leading to a displacement of English people, mostly dispossessed nobility. They settled in neighboring regions including Ireland and Scandinavia, and as far east as Crimea and Anatolia in the Byzantine Empire. Englishmen eventually replaced Scandinavians as the main source of recruitment for the Byzantine Emperor's personal Varangian Guard.\nAfter the Age of Discovery, the various peoples of the British Isles, and especially the English, were among the earliest and by far the largest communities to emigrate out of Europe. Indeed, the British Empire's expansion during the first half of the 19th century saw an extraordinary dispersion of the British people, with particular concentrations in Australasia and North America.\nThe British Empire was \"built on waves of migration overseas by British people\", who left Great Britain, later the United Kingdom, and reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents. As a result of the British colonisation of the Americas, what became the United States was \"easily the greatest single destination of emigrant British\", but in what would become the Commonwealth of Australia the British experienced a birth rate higher than anything seen before, which together with continuing British immigration resulted in a huge outnumbering of indigenous Australians.\nIn colonies such as Southern Rhodesia, British Hong Kong, Singapore, Jamaica, Barbados, Malaysia, and the Cape Colony, permanently resident British communities were established, and while never more than a numerical minority, these Britons exercised a dominant influence upon the culture and politics of those lands. In Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, people of British origin came to constitute the majority of the population, contributing to these states becoming integral to the Anglosphere.\nThe British not only emigrated to parts of the British Empire, but also settled in large numbers in parts of the Americas, particularly in the United States and in sizeable numbers in Argentina, Chile and Mexico.\nThe United Kingdom census, 1861 estimated the number of overseas British to be around 2.5 million. However, it concluded that most of these were \"not conventional settlers\" but rather \"travellers, merchants, professionals, and military personnel\". By 1890, there were over 1.5 million further British-born people living in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\n\n=== British diaspora today ===\nAccording to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, there were 13.1 million British nationals living abroad in 2004–05. These figures are taken from the consular annual returns from overseas posts. There is no requirement for UK citizens to register with British missions overseas, so these figures are therefore based on the most reliable information that can be obtained, e.g. from host government official statistics.\nA 2006 publication from the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated that 5.5 million British-born people lived outside the United Kingdom.\nIn terms of outbound expatriation, in 2009, the United Kingdom had the most expatriates among developed OECD countries, with more than three million British living abroad, a figure followed by Germany and Italy. On an annual basis, emigration from Britain stood at about 400,000 per year during the ten years until 2010 at least.\nLiving abroad can affect certain rights for British citizens living abroad; for example, until the passing of the Elections Act 2022, those resident outside the UK for more than 15 years ceased to be eligible to vote, but this restriction was removed, taking effect before the 2024 general election In addition, the British Mental Health Act 1983 rules that persons resident abroad do not qualify as \"nearest relative\" of a person who is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe earliest migrations of Britons date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD, when Brittonic Celts fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasions migrated what is today northern France and north western Spain and forged the colonies of Brittany and Britonia. Brittany remained independent of France until the early 16th century and still retains a distinct Brittonic culture and language, whilst Britonia in modern Galicia was absorbed into Spanish states by the end of the 9th century AD.\nBritons – people with British citizenship or of British descent – have a significant presence in a number of countries other than the United Kingdom, and in particular in those with historic connections to the British Empire. After the Age of Discovery, the British were one of the earliest and largest communities to emigrate out of Europe, and the British Empire's expansion during the first half of the 19th century triggered an \"extraordinary dispersion of the British people\", resulting in particular concentrations \"in Australasia and North America\".\nThe United Kingdom Census 1861 estimated the size of the overseas British to be around 2.5 million, but concluded that most of these were \"not conventional settlers\" but rather \"travellers, merchants, professionals, and military personnel\". By 1890, there were over 1.5 million further UK-born people living in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A 2006 publication from the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 5.6 million Britons lived outside of the United Kingdom.\nOutside of the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories, up to 76% of Australians, 70% of New Zealanders, 48% of Canadians, 33% of Americans and 3% of South Africans have ancestry from the British Isles. Hong Kong has the highest proportion of British nationals outside of the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories, with 47% of Hong Kong residents holding a British National (Overseas) status or a British citizenship. The next highest concentrations of British citizens outside of the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories are located in Barbados (10%), the Republic of Ireland (7%), Australia (6%) and New Zealand (5%).\n\n^  Note: A different estimate puts China (incl. Hong Kong) ahead with a population of 3,750,000 British citizens, most of which are those in Hong Kong who have continued to possess British nationality, particularly the British nationals (overseas) status, which numbered 3.4 million, through their connection with the former crown colony (see British nationality and Hong Kong for further details).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe British diaspora played a significant role in bringing British sports to the world. British sailors and soldiers contributed to association football becoming the most popular sport in the world.\nIn a few places, Britons helped establish cricket, only for it to be replaced by baseball, an American sport with English antecedents. This happened in the United States and then later Japan in the late 19th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnglosphere\nBritish Empire\nCommonwealth diaspora\nCANZUK\n\n\n== References ==\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nEmber, Carol R.; et al.

Mackender put a series of advertisements in The Stage appealing for items of music hall interest 'for safekeeping....' Out of this emerged the British Music Hall Society (\"BMHS\")\nAn Exhibition and Variety Show, known as the \"Festival of Music Hall\" was organised by the society and the then Variety Artistes' Federation on 2 November 1963 to celebrate the centenary of McDonald's Music Hall (now Hoxton Hall).\nIn December 1963, the first edition of the society's journal, The Call Boy, was published. The Journal continues as a quarterly publication, free to society members.\nThe first of what was to become a regular monthly meeting of the society took place on 7 January 1964 at the Garrick Hotel, Charing Cross Road, London, with Ada Reeve as the guest of honour.\nIn 2013, the society celebrated their 50th anniversary with a Festival of Music Hall (and Variety) at Wilton's Music Hall, Whitechapel, London. Since 2014, the society has held an annual one-day event, Day by the Sea at the Royal Hippodrome Theatre, Eastbourne, featuring comedy, music, discussion and film footage.\nThe society holds an extensive archive with photographs, posters, sheet music, playbills, programmes and the personal items of many artistes including Marie Lloyd, Little Tich, Max Miller, Florrie Forde, Ida Barr, Hetty King and Harry Tate.

      "title": "History of the United Kingdom",
      "content": "The history of the United Kingdom begins in 1707 with the Treaty of Union and Acts of Union. The core of the United Kingdom as a unified state came into being with the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, into a new unitary state called Great Britain. Of this new state, the historian Simon Schama said:\n\nWhat began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\nThe Acts of Union 1800 added the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe first decades were marked by Jacobite risings which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In 1763, victory in the Seven Years' War led to the growth of the First British Empire. With defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, Great Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa. As a result, British culture, and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide. Politically the central event was the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury. Culturally, the Victorian era was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century from 1815 to 1914. The First World War, with Britain in alliance with France, Russia and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting League of Nations was a favourite project in Interwar Britain. However, while the Empire remained strong, as did the London financial markets, the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and, especially, the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitler's Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 started the Second World War. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the US joined the UK as the main Allied powers.\nBritain was no longer a military or economic superpower, as seen in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Britain no longer had the wealth to maintain an empire, so it granted independence to almost all its possessions. The new states typically joined the Commonwealth of Nations. The postwar years saw great hardships, alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the United States, and some from Canada. Prosperity returned in the 1950s. Meanwhile, from 1945 to 1950, the Labour Party built a welfare state, nationalized many industries, and created the National Health Service. The UK took a strong stand against Communist expansion after 1945, playing a major role in the Cold War and the formation of NATO as an anti-Soviet military alliance with West Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Canada and smaller countries. NATO remains a powerful military coalition. The UK has been a leading member of the United Nations since its founding, as well as numerous other international organizations. In the 1990s, neoliberalism led to the privatisation of nationalised industries and significant deregulation of business affairs. London's status as a world financial hub grew continuously. Since the 1990s, large-scale devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have decentralised political decision-making. Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. It joined the European Economic Community in 1973, thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. However, the Brexit referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the European Union, which it did in 2020.\nIn 1922, 26 counties of Ireland seceded to become the Irish Free State; a day later, Northern Ireland seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its formal title to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to Britain and (after 1945) to the United Kingdom or UK.\n\n\n== 18th century ==\n\n\n=== Birth of the Union ===\n\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain came into being on 1 May 1707, as a result of the political union of the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Treaty of Union. This combined the two kingdoms into a single kingdom and merged the two parliaments into a single parliament of Great Britain. Queen Anne became the first monarch of the new Great Britain. Although now a single kingdom, certain institutions of Scotland and England remained separate, such as Scottish and English law; and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Anglican Church of England. England and Scotland each also continued to have their own system of education.\n\nMeanwhile, the War of the Spanish Succession against France was underway. It see-sawed back and forth until a more peace-minded government came to power in London and the treaties of Utrecht and Rastadt ended the war. British historian G. M. Trevelyan argues: That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large,—the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.\n\n\n=== Hanoverian kings ===\n\nThe Stuart line died with Anne in 1714, although a die-hard faction with French support supported pretenders. The Elector of Hanover became king as George I. He paid more attention to Hanover and surrounded himself with Germans, making him an unpopular king. He did, however, build up the army and created a more stable political system in Britain and helped bring peace to northern Europe. Jacobite factions seeking a Stuart restoration remained strong; they instigated a revolt in 1715–1716. The son of James II planned to invade England, but before he could do so, John Erskine, Earl of Mar, launched an invasion from Scotland, which was easily defeated.\nGeorge II enhanced the stability of the constitutional system, with a government run by Robert Walpole during the period 1730–1742. He built up the First British Empire, strengthening the colonies in the Caribbean and North America. In coalition with the rising power Prussia, the United Kingdom defeated France in the Seven Years' War, and won full control of Canada.\nGeorge III never visited Hanover, and spoke English as his first language. Reviled by Americans as a tyrant and the instigator of the American War of Independence, he was insane off and on after 1788, and his eldest son served as regent. He was the last king to dominate government and politics, and his long reign is noted for losing the first British Empire in the American Revolutionary War (1783), as France sought revenge for its defeat in the Seven Years' War by aiding the Americans. The reign was notable for the building of a second empire based in India, Asia and Africa, the beginnings of the industrial revolution that made Britain an economic powerhouse, and above all the life and death struggle with the French, in the French Revolutionary Wars, which ended inconclusively with a short truce, and the epic Napoleonic Wars, which ended with the decisive defeat of Napoleon.\n\n\n=== South Sea Bubble ===\nEntrepreneurs gradually extended the range of their business around the globe. The South Sea Bubble was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a joint-stock company in London. Its ostensible object was to grant trade monopolies in South America; but its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to £31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It raised money four times in 1720 by issuing stock, which was purchased by about 8,000 investors. The share price kept soaring every day, from £130 a share to £1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king. Robert Walpole managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.\n\n\n=== Robert Walpole ===\nRobert Walpole is now generally regarded as the first Prime Minister, from, 1721–1742, and indeed he invented the role. The term was applied to him by friends and foes alike by 1727. Historian Clayton Roberts summarizes his new functions:\n\nHe monopolized the counsels of the King, he closely superintended the administration, he ruthlessly controlled patronage, and he led the predominant party in Parliament.\nWalpole was a master of the effective use of patronage, as were his two disciples who succeeded him as prime minister, Henry Pelham and Pelham's brother the Duke of Newcastle.\n\n\n=== Moralism, benevolence and hypocrisy ===\n\nHypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The Toleration Act 1688 allowed for certain rights for religious minorities, but Protestant Nonconformists (such as Congregationalists and Baptists) were still deprived of important rights, such as the right to hold office. Nonconformists who wanted to hold office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged. They outlawed what they called \"occasional conformity\" in 1711 with the Occasional Conformity Act 1711. In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation. This campaign of moderation versus zealotry peaked in 1709 during the impeachment trial of high church preacher Henry Sacheverell. Historian Mark Knights argues that by its very ferocity, the debate may have led to more temperate and less hypercharged political discourse. \"Occasional conformity\" was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.\nEnglish author Bernard Mandeville's famous \"The Fable of the Bees\" explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. On one hand, Mandeville was a \"moralist\" heir to the French Augustinianism of the previous century, viewing sociability as a mere mask for vanity and pride. On the other, he was a \"materialist\" who helped found modern economics. He tried to demonstrate the universality of human appetites for corporeal pleasures. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced Adam Smith and 19th-century Utilitarianism. A tension arose between these two approaches concerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviour, and the historical variability of human cultures.\nFrom around 1750 to 1850, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding and counselling reform initiatives to prevent the outbreaks of popular discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy—alleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power while preserving their precious aristocratic exclusiveness. Historian L.G. Mitchell defends the Whigs, pointing out that thanks to them radicals always had friends at the centre of the political elite, and thus did not feel as marginalised as in most of Europe. He points out that the debates on the 1832 Reform Bill showed that reformers would indeed receive a hearing at parliamentary level with a good chance of success. Meanwhile, a steady stream of observers from the Continent commented on the English political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the English lower classes in the early 19th century, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the aristocracy, and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. There were not so many conservative visitors. They praised the stability of English society, its ancient constitution, and reverence for the past; they ignored the negative effects of industrialisation.\nHistorians have explored crimes and vices of England's upper classes, especially duelling, suicide, adultery and gambling. They were tolerated by the same courts that executed thousands of poor men and boys for lesser offenses. No aristocrat was punished for killing someone in a duel. However the emerging popular press specialized in sensationalistic stories about upper-class vice, which led the middle classes to focus their critiques on a decadent aristocracy that had much more money, but much less morality than the middle class.\n\n\n=== Warfare and finance ===\n\nFrom 1700 to 1850, Britain was involved in 137 wars or rebellions. It maintained a relatively large and expensive Royal Navy, along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in the sources of government financing, from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes; and, after 1790, an income tax. Working with bankers in the city, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.\nThe French Revolution polarised British political opinion in the 1790s, with conservatives outraged at the killing of the king, the expulsion of the nobles, and the Reign of Terror. Britain was at war against France almost continuously from 1793 until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Conservatives castigated every radical opinion in Britain as \"Jacobin\" (in reference to the leaders of the Terror), warning that radicalism threatened an upheaval of British society. The Anti-Jacobin sentiment, well expressed by Edmund Burke and many popular writers was strongest among the landed gentry and the upper classes.\n\n\n=== British Empire ===\n\nThe Seven Years' War, which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale, fought in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and coastal Africa. Britain was the big winner as it enlarged its empire at the expense of France and others. France lost its role as a colonial power in North America. It ceded New France to Britain, putting a large, traditionalistic French-speaking Catholic element under British control. Spain ceded Florida to Britain, but it only had a few small outposts there. In India, the Carnatic war had left France still in control of its small enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain. The British victory over France in the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's dominant colonial power.\n\n\n==== American Revolution ====\nDuring the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of growing anger against Parliament's repeated attempts to tax American colonists without their consent. The Americans readied their large militias, but were short of gunpowder and artillery. The British assumed falsely that they could easily suppress Patriot resistance. In 1775 the American Revolutionary War began. In 1776 the Patriots expelled all the royal officials and declared the independence of the United States of America. After capturing a British invasion army in 1777, the new nation formed an alliance with France (and in turn Spain aided France), equalizing the military and naval balance and putting Britain at risk of invasion from France. The British army controlled only a handful of coastal cities in the U.S. 1780–1781 was a low point for Britain. Taxes and deficits were high, government corruption was pervasive, and the war in America was entering its sixth year with no apparent end in sight. The Gordon Riots erupted in London during the spring of 1780, in response to increased concessions to Catholics by Parliament. In October 1781 Lord Cornwallis surrendered his army at Yorktown, Virginia. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, formally terminating the war and recognising the independence of the United States. The peace terms were very generous to the new nation, which London hoped correctly would become a major trading partner.\n\n\n==== Second British Empire ====\nThe loss of the Thirteen Colonies, at the time Britain's most populous colonies, marked the transition between the \"first\" and \"second\" empires, in which Britain shifted its attention to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 confirmed Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.\nDuring its first 100 years of operation, the focus of the British East India Company had been trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the British East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the French East India Company, during the Carnatic wars of the 1740s and 1750s. The British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French and their Indian allies in the Battle of Plassey, leaving the Company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force of the Indian Army, 80% of which was composed of native Indian sepoys.\n\nOn 22 August 1770, James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788.\n\n\n=== Wars with Revolutionary France ===\nThe British government had somewhat mixed reactions to the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, and when war broke out on the Continent in 1792, it initially remained neutral. But the following January, Louis XVI was beheaded. This combined with a threatened invasion of the Netherlands by France spurred Britain to declare war. For the next 23 years, the two nations were at war except for a short period in 1802–1803. Britain alone among the nations of Europe never submitted to or formed an alliance with France. Throughout the 1790s, the British repeatedly defeated the navies of France and its allies, but were unable to perform any significant land operations. An Anglo-Russian invasion of the Netherlands in 1799 accomplished little except the capture of the Dutch fleet.\n\n\n== 1800 to 1837 ==\n\n\n=== Union with Ireland ===\n\nOn 1 January 1801, the first day of the 19th century, the Great Britain and Ireland joined to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was brought about by the Act of Union 1800, creating the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". The Act was passed in both the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland, dominated by the Protestant Ascendancy and lacking representation of the country's Catholic population. Substantial majorities were achieved, and according to contemporary documents this was assisted by bribery in the form of the awarding of peerages and honours to opponents to gain their votes.\nUnder the terms of the merger, the separate Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland were abolished, and replaced by a united Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ireland thus became an integral part of the United Kingdom, sending around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28 Irish representative peers to the House of Lords, elected from among their number by the Irish peers themselves, except that Roman Catholic peers were not permitted to take their seats in the Lords. Part of the trade-off for the Irish Catholics was to be the granting of Catholic emancipation, which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by King George III, who argued that emancipating the Roman Catholics would breach his Coronation Oath. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined the appeal of the Union.\n\n\n=== Napoleonic wars ===\n\nAt the threshold to the 19th century, Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations: the constitutional monarchy of Great Britain versus the liberal principles of the French Revolution ostensibly championed by the Napoleonic empire. It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened invasion of Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun.\nDuring the War of the Second Coalition, Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch colonies (the Netherlands had been a satellite of France since 1796), but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the Treaty of Amiens created a pause, Britain was forced to return most of the colonies. In May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon's plans to invade Britain failed due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805, Lord Nelson's fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars.\nIn 1806, Napoleon issued the series of Berlin Decrees, which brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to weaken the British export economy closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Napoleon hoped that isolating Britain from the Continent would end its economic dominance. It never succeeded in its objective. Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. Britain's naval supremacy meant that France could never enjoy the peace necessary to consolidate its control over Europe, and it could threaten neither the home islands nor the main British colonies.\n\nThe Dos de Mayo Uprising at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and von Blücher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.\n\n\n==== Financing the war ====\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813. Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The British budget in 1814 reached £66 million, including £10 million for the Navy, £40 million for the Army, £10 million for the Allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The whole cost of the war came to £831 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.\nNapoleon also attempted economic warfare against Britain, especially in the Berlin Decree of 1806. It forbade the import of British goods into European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and installed the Continental System in Europe. All connections were to be cut, even the mail. British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war. There was some damage to Britain, especially in 1808 and 1811, but its control of the oceans helped ameliorate the damage. Even more damage was done to the economies of France and its allies, which lost a useful trading partner. Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon's coalition.\n\n\n==== War of 1812 with United States ====\n\nSimultaneous with the Napoleonic Wars, trade disputes and British impressment of American sailors led to the War of 1812 with the United States. This was the \"Second War of Independence\" for the Americans, though in reality, it was never about British efforts to conquer the former colonies, but about the conquest of the Canadian colonies by the Americans. It was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American frigates also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe. A stepped-up war effort that year brought about some successes such as the burning of Washington, but many influential voices such as the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the US was impossible.\nPeace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but Andrew Jackson, unaware of this, won a great victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). Ratification of the Treaty of Ghent ended the war in February 1815. The major result was the permanent defeat of the Indian allies the British had counted upon. The US-Canada border was demilitarised by both countries, and peaceful trade resumed, although worries of an American conquest of Canada persisted into the 1860s.\n\n\n=== Postwar reaction: 1815–1822 ===\n\n\n==== Repression by reactionary landed elites ====\nThe postwar era was a time of economic depression, poor harvests, growing inflation, and high unemployment among returning soldiers. As industrialisation progressed, Britain was more urban and less rural, and power shifted accordingly. The dominant Tory leadership, based in the declining rural sector, was fearful, reactionary and repressive. Tories feared the possible emergence of radicals who might be conspiring to emulate the dreaded French Revolution. In reality the violent radical element was small and weak; there were a handful of small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed. Techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to arrest and hold suspects without cause or trial). Sidmouth's Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week. In reaction to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, the Liverpool government passed the \"Six Acts\" in 1819. They prohibited drills and military exercises; facilitated warrants for the search for weapons; outlawed public meetings of more than 50 people, including meetings to organize petitions; put heavy penalties on blasphemous and seditious publications; imposing a fourpenny stamp act on many pamphlets to cut down the flow on news and criticism. Offenders could be harshly punished including exile in Australia. In practice the laws were designed to deter troublemakers and reassure conservatives; they were not often used. By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.\n\n\n==== Weak monarchs ====\nGeorge IV was a weak ruler as regent (1811–1820) and king (1820–1830). He let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. The principle now became established that the king accepts as prime minister the person who wins a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favours him or not. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. His brother William IV ruled 1830 to 1837, but was little involved in politics. His reign saw several reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in nearly all the British Empire, and, most important, the Reform Act 1832 refashioned the British electoral system.\n\n\n==== Foreign affairs ====\nThere were no major wars until the Crimean War of 1853–1856. While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain's American colonies in 1824. British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations. The British intervened in 1827 on the side of the Greeks, who had been waging the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire since 1821.\n\n\n==== Whig reforms of the 1830s ====\nThe Whig Party recovered its strength and unity by supporting moral reforms, especially the reform of the electoral system, the abolition of slavery and emancipation of the Catholics. Catholic emancipation was secured in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Britain.\nThe Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made Lord Grey prime minister 1830–1834, and the Reform Act 1832 became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise slightly and ended the system of rotten and pocket boroughs (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and gave seats to new industrial centres. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society. After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.\nChartism emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote to the working class. Activists denounced the 'betrayal' of the working class and the 'sacrificing' of their interests by the 'misconduct' of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of MPs (so poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. Elites saw the movement as pathological, so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th-century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.\nIn 1832, Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The government purchased the slaves for £20,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.\n\n\n==== Leadership ====\nPrime Ministers of the period included: William Pitt the Younger, Lord Grenville, Duke of Portland, Spencer Perceval, Lord Liverpool, George Canning, Lord Goderich, Duke of Wellington, Lord Grey, Lord Melbourne, and Robert Peel.\n\n\n== Victorian era ==\n\nVictoria ascended the throne in 1837 at age 18. Her long reign until 1901 saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power. Exciting new technologies such as steam ships, railways, photography, and telegraphs appeared, making the world much faster-paced. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics, and it was not affected by the wave of revolutions in 1848. The Victorian era saw the fleshing out of the second British Empire. Scholars debate whether the Victorian period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians—actually begins with her coronation or the earlier passage of the Reform Act 1832. The era was preceded by the Georgian era and succeeded by the Edwardian era.\nHistorians like Bernard Porter have characterized the mid-Victorian era, (1850–1870) as Britain's 'Golden Years'. There was peace and prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half. Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialization, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of trade and engineering that produce profits for British merchants and experts from across the globe. There was peace abroad (apart from the short Crimean war, 1854–1856), and social peace at home. Reforms in industrial conditions were set by Parliament. For example, in 1842, the nation was scandalized by the use of children in coal mines. The Mines and Collieries Act 1842 banned employment of girls and boys under ten years old from working underground in coal mines. Opposition to the new order melted away, says Porter. The Chartist movement, peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies. The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity. Employers typically were paternalistic, and generally recognized the trade unions. Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia. Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes aspire to middle-class norms of 'respectability.'\n\nThere was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free. Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal. There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism. Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, which controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military. Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate. Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music. The educational system was mediocre; the capstone universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre. Historian Llewellyn Woodward has concluded:\n\nFor leisure or work, for getting or spending, England was a better country in 1879 than in 1815. The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor. There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age. The public conscience was more instructed, and the content of liberty was being widened to include something more than freedom from political constraint.... Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise. The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town & country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.\nAccording to historians David Brandon and Alan Brooke, the new system of railways after 1830 brought into being our modern world:\n\nThey stimulated demand for building materials, coal, iron and, later, steel. Excelling in the bulk movement of coal, they provided the fuel for the furnaces of industry and for domestic fireplaces. Millions of people were able to travel who had scarcely ever travelled before. Railways enabled mail, newspapers, periodicals and cheap literature to be distributed easily, quickly and cheaply allowing a much wider and faster dissemination of ideas and information. They had a significant impact on improving diet....[and thus] a proportionately smaller agricultural industry was able to feed a much larger urban population.... They employed huge quantities of labour both directly and indirectly. They helped Britain to become the 'Workshop of the World' by reducing transport costs not only of raw materials but of finished goods, large amounts of which were exported.... Today's global corporations originated with the great limited liability railway companies.... By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, there was scarcely any person living in Britain whose life had not been altered in some way by the coming of the railways. Railways contributed to the transformation of Britain from a rural to a predominantly urban society.\n\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\n\n==== Free trade imperialism ====\n\nThe Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment, it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule and an informal one based on the British pound.\n\n\n==== Russia, France and the Ottoman Empire ====\n\nOne nagging fear was the possible collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head that off Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the Bosporous Straits, as well as from threatening India via Afghanistan. In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the Crimean War and defeated Russia at a very high cost in casualties. In the 1870s the Congress of Berlin blocked Russia from imposing the harsh Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottoman Empire. Despite its alliance with the French in the Crimean War, Britain viewed the Second Empire of Napoleon III with some distrust, especially as the emperor constructed ironclad warships and began returning France to a more active foreign policy.\n\n\n==== American Civil War ====\n\nDuring the American Civil War, British leaders personally disliked American republicanism and favoured the more aristocratic Confederacy, as it had been a major source of cotton for textile mills, but the country never recognized the Confederacy and neither signed a treaty with it. Prince Albert was effective in defusing a war scare in late 1861. The British people, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the United States. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, Britain (along with France) contemplated stepping in and negotiating a peace settlement, which could only mean war with the United States. But in the same month, US president Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation would be issued in January 1863 making abolition of slavery in the Confederacy a war goal. Since support of the Confederacy now meant support for slavery, there was no longer any possibility of European intervention. However, the British working class were quite overwhelmingly pro-Union. In the end, although Britain could survive without Southern cotton, the North's meat and grain was more important to feed the UK's urban population, especially as a series of bad harvests had affected British agriculture in the late 1850s to early 1860s.\nMeanwhile, the British sold arms to both sides, built blockade runners for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy. The warships caused a major diplomatic row that was resolved in the Alabama Claims in 1872, in the Americans' favour.\n\n\n==== Empire expands ====\nIn 1867, Britain united most of its North American colonies as Canada, giving it self-government and responsibility for its internal affairs. Britain handled foreign policy and defence. The second half of the 19th century saw a major expansion of Britain's colonial empire in Asia and Africa as well as the Pacific. In the \"Scramble for Africa\", the boast was having the Union Jack flying from \"Cairo to Cape Town.\" Britain defended its empire with the world's dominant navy, and a small professional army. It was the only power in Europe to have no conscription.\nThe rise of the German Empire after 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States) threatened to take Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor Otto von Bismarck succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When William II became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain's.\n\n\n=== Boer War ===\n\nEver since Britain had taken control of South Africa from the Netherlands in the Napoleonic Wars, it had run afoul of the Dutch settlers who further away and created two republics of their own. The British imperial vision called for control over the new countries and the Dutch-speaking \"Boers\" (or \"Afrikaners\") fought back in the War in 1899. British historian Andrew Roberts argues that the Boers insisted on keeping full control of both their two small republics, allowing no role whatever for nonwhites, and distinctly limited roles for British and other European settlers. These \"Uitlanders\" were the base of the economy, paid 80% of the taxes, and had no vote. The Transvaal was in no sense a democracy, argues Roberts, for no black, Briton, Catholic, or Jew was allowed to vote or hold any office. Johannesburg was the business centre, with 50,000 primarily British residents, but was not permitted any local government. The English language was banned in official proceedings; no public meetings were permitted; newspapers were closed down arbitrarily; and full citizenship was technically possible but quite rare. Roberts says President Paul Kruger \"ran a tight, tough, quasi-police state from his state capital, Pretoria.\" The British government officially protested; while theoretically recognizing the Transvaal's right to manage its internal affairs, cabinet member Joseph Chamberlain detailed the many ways how Uitlanders were mistreated as second-class non-citizens, despite their essential role in producing prosperity.\nThe Boer response to the British pressure was to declare war on 20 October 1899. The 410,000 Boers were massively outnumbered, but amazingly they waged a successful guerrilla war, which gave the British regulars a difficult fight. The Boers were landlocked and did not have access to outside help. The weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics eventually brought about a British victory. To defeat the guerrillas, the British rounded up their women and children into concentration camps, where many died of disease. World outrage focused on the camps, led by a large faction of the Liberal Party in Britain. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into Union of South Africa in 1910; it had internal self-government but its foreign policy was controlled by London and was an integral part of the British Empire.\n\nThe unexpectedly great difficulty in defeating the Boers forced a reevaluation of British policy. In military terms, it was clear that the Cardwell reforms had been inadequate. The call to establish a general staff to control military operations had been shelved by the Duke of Cambridge, himself a royal with enormous authority. It took a five more years to set up a general staff and other Army reforms, under the administration of Lord Haldane. The Royal Navy was now threatened by Germany. Britain responded by a massive building programme launched in 1904 by the highly controversial First Sea Lord, John Fisher. He launched HMS Dreadnought in 1906. It was the first modern battleship, based on new armour, new propulsion, new guns and gunnery that made all other warships obsolete. The Boer War demonstrated that Britain was not loved around the world—it had more enemies than friends and its policy of \"splendid isolation\" was one of high risk. It needed new friends. It made a military alliance with Japan, and buried old controversies to forge a close relationship with the United States.\n\n\n=== Ireland and Home Rule ===\n\nPart of the agreement which led to the Acts of Union 1800 stipulated that the Penal Laws in Ireland were to be repealed and Catholic emancipation granted. However, King George III blocked emancipation. A campaign under Daniel O'Connell led to the concession of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, allowing Catholics to sit in Parliament.\nWhen potato blight hit Ireland in 1846, much of the rural population was left without food. Relief efforts were inadequate and hundreds of thousands died in the Great Hunger. Millions more migrated to England, or to North America. Ireland became permanently smaller in terms of population.\nIn the 1870s new moderate nationalist movement was formed. As the Irish Parliamentary Party it became a major factor in parliament under Charles Stewart Parnell. Home Rule Bills introduced by Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone failed of passage, and split the Liberals. A significant unionist minority (largely based in Ulster), opposed Home Rule, fearing that a Catholic-Nationalist parliament in Dublin would discriminate against them and would also hurt its industry. Parliament passed laws in 1870, 1881, 1903 and 1909 that enabled most tenant farmers to purchase their lands, and lowered the rents of the others.\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\nHistorically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. High Society in London, following the Queen, largely ostracized home rulers, and Liberal clubs were badly split. Joseph Chamberlain took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party, the Liberal Unionists, which collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party. The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted the Newcastle Programme that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation, and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the Nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.\n\n\n==== Queen Victoria ====\nQueen Victoria played a small role in politics, but became the iconic symbol of the nation, the empire, and proper, restrained behaviour. Her strength lay in good common sense and directness of character; she expressed the qualities of the British nation which at that time made it preeminent in the world. As a symbol of domesticity, endurance and Empire, and as a woman holding the highest public office during an age when middle- and upper-class women were expected to beautify the home while men dominated the public sphere, Queen Victoria's influence has been enduring. Her success as ruler was due to the power of the self-images she successively portrayed of innocent young woman, devoted wife and mother, suffering and patient widow, and grandmotherly matriarch.\n\n\n==== Palmerston ====\nLord Palmerston dominated foreign policy for decades, through a period when Britain was at the height of its power, serving terms as both Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister. He became controversial at the time, and remains so today, for his aggressive bullying and his \"liberal interventionist\" policies. He was intensely patriotic; he used the Royal Navy to undermine the Atlantic slave trade.\n\n\n==== Disraeli ====\n\nDisraeli and Gladstone dominated the politics of the late 19th century, Britain's golden age of parliamentary government. They long were idolized, but historians in recent decades have become much more critical, especially regarding Disraeli.\nBenjamin Disraeli (prime minister 1868 and 1874–1880) remains an iconic hero of the Conservative Party. He played a central role in the creation of the Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal leader William Gladstone, and his one-nation conservatism or \"Tory democracy\". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the British Empire. He was born into a Jewish family, which became Episcopalian when he was 12 years old.\nDisraeli fought to protect established political, social, and religious values and elites; he emphasized the need for national leadership in response to radicalism, uncertainty, and materialism. He is especially known for his enthusiastic support for expanding and strengthening the British Empire in India and Africa as the foundation of British greatness, in contrast to Gladstone's negative attitude toward imperialism. Gladstone denounced Disraeli's policies of territorial aggrandizement, military pomp, and imperial symbolism (such as making the Queen Empress of India), saying it did not fit a modern commercial and Christian nation.\nIn foreign policy he is best known for battling and besting Russia. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the Eastern question—the slow decay of the Ottoman Empire and the desire of Russia to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the Suez Canal Company (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the Congress of Berlin to maintain peace in the Balkans and made terms favourable to Britain which weakened Russia, its longstanding enemy.\nDisraeli's old reputation as the \"Tory democrat\" and promoter of the welfare state has faded as historians argue that he had few proposals for social legislation in 1874–1880, and that the 1867 Reform Act did not reflect a vision for the unenfranchised working man. However he did work to reduce class antagonism, for as Perry notes, \"When confronted with specific problems, he sought to reduce tension between town and country, landlords and farmers, capital and labour, and warring religious sects in Britain and Ireland—in other words, to create a unifying synthesis.\"\n\n\n==== Gladstone ====\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone was the Liberal counterpart to Disraeli, serving as prime minister four times (1868–1874, 1880–1885, 1886, and 1892–1894). He was the moral compass of the Liberal Party and is famous for his oratory, his religiosity, his liberalism, his rivalry with Disraeli, and for his poor relations with the Queen. Although he personally was not a Nonconformist, and rather disliked them in person, he formed a coalition with the Nonconformists that gave the Liberals a powerful base of support.\nGladstone's first ministry saw many reforms including Disestablishment of the Protestant Church of Ireland and the introduction of secret voting. His party was defeated in 1874, but made a comeback based on opposition to the Ottoman Empire's Bulgarian atrocities against Christians. Gladstone's Midlothian campaign of 1879–1880 was a pathbreaking introduction of many modern political campaigning techniques. His Liberal party was increasingly pulled apart on the Irish issue. He proposed Irish home rule in 1886; It failed to pass and the resulting split in the Liberal Party kept it out of office for most of the next 20 years.\nGladstone's financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and laissez-faire, were suited to a developing capitalist society but could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the \"Grand Old Man\" later in life, he was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to British workers and lower middle class. The deeply religious Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics with his evangelical sensibility and opposition to aristocracy. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria, who strongly favoured Disraeli), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal party. His foreign policy goal was to create a European order based on cooperation rather than conflict and mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the rule of law was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious Concert of Europe was opposed to and ultimately defeated by the Germans with a Bismarckian system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.\nRegarding Ireland, the major Liberal efforts focused on land reform with the Land Acts, and the disestablishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland through the Irish Church Act 1869. Gladstone became a champion of Home Rule, but it caused a deep split in the Liberal Party. Joseph Chamberlain formed the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party that refused to consider Home Rule for Ireland and became allied with the Conservatives.\nIn terms of historic reforms, Gladstone's first ministry 1868–1874 was his most successful. He was an idealist who insisted that government should take the lead in making society more efficient, more fair, and that the government should expand its role in society in order to extend liberty and toleration. The Education Act of 1870 made universal schooling a major national policy. The justice system was made up of multiple overlapping and conflicting courts dating back centuries. The Judicature Act of 1873 merged them into one central court. In local government the challenges of sanitation and clean water in fast-growing cities were met with new powers in the realm of public health. Local government was streamlined in a later Gladstone ministry, and made more powerful and standardized. Patronage and favouritism were replaced by civil service examinations, downplaying the role of family and aristocracy and emphasizing the role of talent and ability. The secret ballot was enacted in 1872 to prevent the buying of votes—politicians would not pay out the money if they were not sure how the person voted. The Trade Union Act 1871 lessened the intimidation of employers, made unions legal, and protected their funding from lawsuits. The Protestant Church of Ireland was disestablished. Catholics no longer had to pay taxes to it. While the Navy was in fine shape, the Army was not. Its organization was confused, its policies unfair, and its punishments were based chiefly on flogging. At the county level, politicians named the officers of the county militia units, preferring connections in class over capacity. The regular army called for enlistments for 21 years, but with reforms initiated by Edward Cardwell, Gladstone's War Secretary, enlistments were reduced to six years, plus six years in the reserves. Regiments were organized by territorial districts, and advanced with modern rifles. The complex chain of command was simplified, and in wartime the county militias were under the control of the central war office. The purchase of officers' commissions was abolished, as was flogging in peacetime. The reforms were not quite complete, the Duke of Cambridge, as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, still had great authority, despite his mediocre abilities. Historians have given Gladstone high marks on his successful reform programme.\n\n\n==== Salisbury ====\nHistorians agree that Lord Salisbury as foreign minister and prime minister in the late 19th century was a strong and effective leader in foreign affairs. He had a superb grasp of the issues, and proved:\n\na patient, pragmatic practitioner, with a keen understanding of Britain's historic interests....He oversaw the partition of Africa, the emergence of Germany and the United States as imperial powers, and the transfer of British attention from the Dardanelles to Suez without provoking a serious confrontation of the great powers.\nConservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury was a \"talented leader who was an icon of traditional, aristocratic conservatism\". Salisbury was \"a great foreign minister, [but] essentially negative, indeed reactionary in home affairs\". Another historian's estimate is more favourable; he portrays Salisbury as a leader who \"held back the popular tide for twenty years.\" \"[I]nto the 'progressive' strain of modern Conservatism he simply will not fit.\" One historian pointed to \"the narrow cynicism of Salisbury\". One admirer of Salisbury agrees that Salisbury found the democracy born of the 1867 and 1884 Reform Acts as \"perhaps less objectionable than he had expected—succeeding, through his public persona, in mitigating some part of its nastiness.\"\n\n\n== Early 20th century (1901–1918) ==\n\nPrime Ministers from 1900 to 1945: Marquess of Salisbury, Arthur Balfour, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, H. H. Asquith, David Lloyd George, Bonar Law, Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill.\nThe Liberal Party was in power from 1906 to 1915, when it formed a wartime coalition. It passed the welfare reforms that created a basic British welfare state. It weakened the veto power of Lords, blocked woman suffrage. In 1914 it apparently \"solved\" the problem of Irish Home Rule but when the war broke out the solution was shelved. H. H. Asquith was Liberal Prime Minister between 1908 and 1916, followed by David Lloyd George, 1916–1922. Although Asquith was the Party leader, the dominant Liberal was Lloyd George. Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister, and Lloyd George replaced him as the coalition prime minister in late 1916 but Asquith remained Liberal party leader. The two fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process. Historian Martin Pugh in The Oxford Companion to British History argues that Lloyd George:\n\nmade a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader, thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain's social welfare system (especially medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions, largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land). Furthermore, in foreign affairs he played a leading role in winning the First World War, redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference, and partitioning Ireland.\n\n\n=== Edwardian era 1901–1914 ===\n\nQueen Victoria died in 1901 and her son Edward VII became king, inaugurating the Edwardian Era, which was characterised by great and ostentatious displays of wealth in contrast to the sombre Victorian Era. With the advent of the 20th century, things such as motion pictures, automobiles, and aeroplanes were coming into use. The new century was characterised by a feeling of great optimism. The social reforms of the last century continued into the 20th with the Labour Party being formed in 1900. Edward died in 1910, to be succeeded by George V, who reigned 1910–1936. Scandal-free, hard working and popular, George V was the British monarch who, with Queen Mary, established the modern pattern of exemplary conduct for British royalty, based on middle-class values and virtues. He understood the overseas Empire better than any of his prime ministers and used his exceptional memory for figures and details, whether of uniforms, politics, or relations, to good effect in reaching out in conversation with his subjects.\nThe era was prosperous but political crises were escalating out of control. George Dangerfield (1935) identified the \"strange death of liberal England\" as the multiple crisis that hit simultaneously in 1910–1914 with serious social and political instability arising from the Irish crisis, labour unrest, the women's suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed the Army might refuse orders dealing with Northern Ireland. No solution appeared in sight when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold.\nRoss McKibbin argues that the political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance on the eve of the war in 1914. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish Nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), free collective bargaining for trades unions (which Conservatives opposed), an active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together from leftovers from the 1890s. The sociological basis was non-Anglican religion and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasized by Labour.\n\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nOn 4 August 1914, the King declared war on Germany and Austria, following the advice of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith of the Liberal Party. The rest of the Empire automatically followed. The cabinet's basic reasons for declaring war focused on a deep commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals led by Asquith and Foreign Secretary Edward Grey threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France. That would deeply split the party and mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or to the Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition. However, the large antiwar element among Liberals, with David Lloyd George as spokesperson, would support the war to honour the 1839 treaty that guaranteed Belgian neutrality. So Belgium rather than France was the public reason given. Posters took the line that Britain was required to go to war to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London.\n\nBritain actually entered the war to support France, which had entered to support Russia, which in turn had entered to support Serbia. Britain became part of the Triple Entente with France and Russia, which (with smaller allies) fought the Central Powers of Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire. After a few weeks the Western Front turned into a killing ground in which millions of men died but no army made a large advance. The main British contribution was financial—loans and grants helped Russia, Italy and smaller allies afford the war.\nThe stalemate required an endless supply of men and munitions. By 1916, volunteering fell off, the government imposed conscription in Britain (but not in Ireland) to keep up the strength of the Army. With his slow start and mobilization of national resources, H. H. Asquith had proven inadequate: he was more of a committee chairman, and he started to drink so heavily after midday that only his morning hours were effective. Asquith was replaced in December 1916 with the much more effective David Lloyd George. He had strong support from Unionists and considerable backing of Labour, as well as a majority of his own Liberal Party, although Asquith turned hostile. Lloyd George answered the loud demands for a much more decisive government by setting up a new small war cabinet, a cabinet secretariat under Maurice Hankey, and a secretariat of private advisors in the 'Garden Suburb'; he moved towards prime ministerial control.\nBritain eagerly supported the war, but Irish Nationalist opinion was divided: some served in the British Army, but the Irish Republican Brotherhood plotted an Easter Rising in 1916. It quickly failed but the brutal repression that followed turned that element against Britain, as did failed British plans to introduce conscription in Ireland in 1917.\nThe nation now successfully mobilised its manpower, womanpower, industry, finances, Empire and diplomacy, in league with France and the U.S. to defeat the enemy. The British Army had traditionally never been a large employer in the nation, with the regular army standing at 250,000 at the start of the war. By 1918, there were about five million people in the army and the fledgling Royal Air Force, newly formed from the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), was about the same size of the pre-war army. The economy grew about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943). The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from New York banks. After the U.S. entered in April 1917, the Treasury borrowed directly from the U.S. government.\n\nThe Royal Navy dominated the seas, defeating the smaller German fleet in the only major naval battle of the war, the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Germany was blockaded, leading to an increasing shortage of food. Germany's naval strategy increasingly turned towards use of U-boats to strike back against the British, despite the risk of triggering war with the powerful neutral power, the United States. Berlin declared the water routes to Britain were war zones where any ship, neutral or otherwise, was a target. Nevertheless, international route law required giving the crew and passengers an opportunity to get into their lifeboats. In May 1915, a U-boat, without warning, torpedoed the British passenger liner Lusitania; it sank in 18 minutes, drowning over 1000 civilians including over 100 Americans. Vigorous protests by American President Woodrow Wilson forced Berlin to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. With victory over Russia in 1917, the German high command now calculated it could finally have numerical superiority on the Western Front. Planning for a massive spring offensive in 1918, it resumed the sinking of all merchant ships without warning, even if they were flying the American flag. The US entered the war alongside the Allies (without officially joining them), and provided the needed money and supplies to sustain the Allies' war efforts. The U-boat threat was ultimately defeated by a convoy system across the Atlantic.\nOn other fronts, the British, French, New Zealanders, Australians, and Japanese seized Germany's colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the Gallipoli campaign and in Mesopotamia (Iraq), while arousing the Arabs who helped expel the Turks from their lands. Exhaustion and war-weariness were growing worse in 1917, as the fighting in France continued with no end in sight. After defeating Russia, the Germans tried to win in the spring of 1918 before the millions of American soldiers arrived. They failed, and they were overwhelmed by August and finally accepted an Armistice on 11 November 1918, that amounted to a surrender.\nBritish society and government were radically transformed by the repeated calls for manpower, the employment of women, the dramatic increase in industrial production and munitions, price controls and rationing, and the wide and deep emotional patriotism dedicated to winning the war. Parliament took a backseat, as new departments bureaus committees and operations were created every week, experts were consulted, and the prime minister's Orders in Council replaced the slow legislative process. Even after peace arrived, the new size and dynamism had permanently transformed the effectiveness of British government. David Lloyd George, also a Liberal, was the high-powered Minister of Munitions who replaced Asquith in late 1916. He gave energy and dynamism to the war effort with his remarkable ability to convince people to do what he wanted and thus get ideas put into actual useful high-speed motion. His top aide Winston Churchill said of Lloyd George: \"He was the greatest master of the art of getting things done and of putting things through that I ever knew; in fact no British politician my day has possessed half his competence as a mover of men and affairs.\"\nVictorian attitudes and ideals that had continued into the first years of the 20th century changed during the First World War. The almost three million casualties were known as the \"Lost Generation\", and such numbers inevitably left society scarred. The lost generation felt its sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like Siegfried Sassoon's Blighters criticising the ill-informed jingoism of the home front. The lost generation was politically inert, and never had its chance to make a generational change in political power. The young men who governed Britain in 1914 were the same old men who governed Britain in 1939.\n\n\n=== Postwar settlement ===\nThe war had been won by Britain and its allies, but at a terrible human and financial cost, creating a sentiment that wars should never be fought again. The League of Nations was founded with the idea that nations could resolve their differences peacefully, but these hopes were unfulfilled. The harsh peace settlement imposed on Germany would leave it embittered and seeking revenge.\nAt the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Lloyd George, American President Woodrow Wilson and French premier Georges Clemenceau made all the major decisions. They formed the League of Nations as a mechanism to prevent future wars. They sliced up the losers to form new nations in Europe, and divided up the German colonies and Ottoman holdings outside Turkey. They imposed what appeared to be heavy financial reparations (but in the event were of modest size). They humiliated Germany by forcing it to declare its guilt for starting the war, a policy that caused deep resentment in Germany and helped fuel reactions such as Nazism. Britain gained the German colony of Tanganyika and part of Togoland in Africa, while its dominions added other colonies. Britain gained League of Nations mandates over Palestine, which had been partly promised as a homeland for Jewish settlers, and Iraq. Iraq became fully independent in 1932. Egypt, which had been a British protectorate since 1882, became independent in 1922, although the British remained there until 1952.\n\n\n=== Irish independence and partition ===\n\nIn 1912 the House of Commons passed a new Home Rule bill. Under the Parliament Act 1911 the House of Lords retained the power to delay legislation by up to two years, so it was eventually enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1914, but suspended for the duration of the war. Civil war threatened when the Protestant-Unionists of Northern Ireland refused to be placed under Catholic-Nationalist control. Semi-military units were formed ready to fight—the Unionist Ulster Volunteers opposed to the Act and their Nationalist counterparts, the Irish Volunteers supporting the Act. The outbreak of the World War in 1914 put the crisis on political hold. A disorganized Easter Rising in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Nationalist demands for independence. Prime Minister Lloyd George failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the December 1918 General Election Sinn Féin won a majority of Irish seats. Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the First Dáil parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by Dáil Éireann, the self-declared Republic's parliament in January 1919. An Anglo-Irish War was fought between Crown forces and the Irish Republican Army between January 1919 and June 1921. The war ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 that established the Irish Free State. Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became Northern Ireland and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland. Britain officially adopted the name \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927.\n\n\n== Interwar era 1918–1939 ==\n\nHistorian Arthur Marwick sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the Great War, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energized self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial woman suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. The chaperone faded away; village druggists sold contraceptives. Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.\n\n\n=== Popular culture ===\nAs a leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes. The annual vacation became common. Tourists flocked to seaside resorts; Blackpool hosted 7 million visitors a year in the 1930s. Organized leisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs. Heavy drinking declined; there were more competitions that attracted heavy betting. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for the average Englishman, and his interest in spectator sports increased dramatically. By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages and genders in very large numbers, with young women taking the lead. Working-class men wearing flat caps and eating fish and chips were boisterous football spectators. They sang along at the music hall, fancied their pigeons, gambled on horse racing, and took the family to Blackpool in summer. The cartoon realization of this life style Andy Capp began in 1957. Political activists complained that working-class leisure diverted men away from revolutionary agitation.\n\n\n==== Cinema and radio ====\n\nThe British film industry emerged in the 1890s when cinemas in general broke through in the western world, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors and producers. The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 per cent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile—the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets. Bollywood (based in Bombay) dominated the huge Indian market. The most prominent directors remaining in London were Alexander Korda, an expatriate Hungarian, and Alfred Hitchcock. There was a revival of creativity in the 1933–1945 era, especially with the arrival of Jewish filmmakers and actors fleeing the Nazis. Meanwhile, giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 per cent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 per cent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.\nIn radio, British audiences had no choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC, a government agency which had a monopoly on broadcasting. John Reith, an intensely moralistic engineer, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, \"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\"\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nThe British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing. Cricket reflected the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire (except Canada). Test matches began by the 1870s; the most famous are those between Australia and England for The Ashes.\n\n\n==== Reading ====\nAs literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stock, and saw heavy demand for new fiction. A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by Allen Lane at Penguin Books in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downmarket image of American paperbacks. The line signalled cultural self-improvement and political education. However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on Paternoster Square in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.\nRomantic fiction was especially popular, with Mills & Boon the leading publisher. Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy. Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.\n\n\n=== Politics and economics of the 1920s ===\n\n\n==== Expanding the welfare state ====\nTwo major programmes that permanently expanded the welfare state passed in 1919 and 1920 with surprisingly little debate, even as the Conservatives dominated parliament. The Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919 set up a system of government housing that followed the 1918 campaign promises of \"homes fit for heroes.\" This \"Addison Act\", named after the first Minister of Health, Christopher Addison, required local authorities to survey their housing needs and start building houses to replace slums. The Treasury subsidized the low rents. In England and Wales 214,000 houses were built, and the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing.\nThe Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 passed at a time of very little unemployment. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. Historian C. L. Mowat calls these two laws \"Socialism by the back door\", and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.\n\n\n=== Conservative control ===\nThe Lloyd George ministry fell apart in 1922. Stanley Baldwin, as leader of the Conservative Party (1923–1937) and as Prime Minister (in 1923–1924, 1924–1929 and 1935–1937), dominated British politics. His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the National Government. He was the last party leader to win over 50% of the vote (in the general election of 1931). Baldwin's political strategy was to polarize the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle. The polarization did take place and while the Liberals remained active under Lloyd George, they won few seats and were a minor factor until they joined a coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1945 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as admirers of Churchill made him the Conservative icon. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.\nLabour won the 1923 election, but in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority.\nMcKibbin finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.\n\n\n=== Economics ===\nTaxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterwards. Much of the money went for the dole, the weekly unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor. A. J. P. Taylor argues most people \"were enjoying a richer life than any previously known in the history of the world: longer holidays, shorter hours, higher real wages.\"\nThe British economy was lackluster in the 1920s, with sharp declines and high unemployment in heavy industry and coal, especially in Scotland and Wales. Exports of coal and steel fell in half by 1939 and the business community was slow to adopt the new labour and management principles coming from the US, such as Fordism, consumer credit, eliminating surplus capacity, designing a more structured management, and using greater economies of scale. For over a century the shipping industry had dominated world trade, but it remained in the doldrums despite various stimulus efforts by the government. With the very sharp decline in world trade after 1929, its condition became critical.\nChancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill put Britain back on the gold standard in 1925, which many economists blame for the mediocre performance of the economy. Others point to a variety of factors, including the inflationary effects of the World War and supply-side shocks caused by reduced working hours after the war.\nBy the late 1920s, economic performance had stabilised, but the overall situation was disappointing, for Britain had fallen behind the United States as the leading industrial power. There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of south Wales and the industrial north of England became known as \"distressed areas\" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the standard of living continued to improve as local councils built new houses to let to families rehoused from outdated slums, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms and electric lighting now being included in the new properties. The private sector enjoyed a housebuilding boom during the 1930s.\n\n\n==== Labour ====\nDuring the war, trade unions were encouraged and their membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918. They peaked at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.\nCoal was a sick industry; the best seams were being exhausted, raising the cost. Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The 1926 general strike was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3 million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2 million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices. The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the Trades Union Congress (TUC), an umbrella organization of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the Comintern in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as Ernest Bevin considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains. The Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. The coal industry used up the more accessible coal and as costs rose output fell from 2567 million tons in 1924 to 183 million in 1945. The Labour government nationalised the mines in 1947.\n\n\n=== Great Depression ===\n\nThe Great Depression originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterized the US, Germany, Canada and Australia in the 1920s, so its bust appeared less severe. Britain's world trade fell in half (1929–1933), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment. Experts tried to remain optimistic. John Maynard Keynes, who had not predicted the slump, said, \"'There will be no serious direct consequences in London. We find the look ahead decidedly encouraging.\"\nOn the left figures such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, J. A. Hobson, and G. D. H. Cole repeated the warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention. Starting in 1935 the Left Book Club provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.\nParticularly hardest hit by economic problems were the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales; unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on the dole.\nIn 1936, by which time unemployment was lower, 200 unemployed men made a highly publicized march from Jarrow to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor. Although much romanticized by the Left, the Jarrow Crusade marked a deep split in the Labour Party and resulted in no government action. Unemployment remained high until the war absorbed all the job seekers. George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier gives a bleak overview of the hardships of the time.\n\n\n=== Appeasement ===\n\nVivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War made Britain and its leaders strongly inclined to pacifism in the interwar era. The challenge came from dictators, first Benito Mussolini of Italy, then Adolf Hitler of a much more powerful Nazi Germany. The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the Munich Agreement of 1938. Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.\n\n\n== World War II (1939–1945) ==\n\nThe King declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland. During the quiet period of \"Phoney War\", the British sent to France the most highly mechanized army in the world; together with France they had more tanks than Germany, but fewer warplanes. The smashing German victory in Spring 1940 was due entirely to \"superior combat doctrine. Realistic training, imaginative battlefield leadership, and unparalleled initiative from generals down to sergeants.\" The British with the thinnest of margins rescued its main army from Dunkirk (as well as many French soldiers), leaving all their equipment and war supplies behind. Winston Churchill came to power, promising to fight the Germans to the very end. The Germans threatened an invasion—which the Royal Navy was prepared to repel. First the Germans tried to achieve air supremacy but were defeated by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain in late summer 1940. Japan declared war in December 1941, and quickly seized Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma, and threatened Australia and India. Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union (starting in 1941) and very close ties to the United States (starting in 1940). The war was very expensive. It was paid for by high taxes, by selling off assets, and by accepting large amounts of Lend-Lease from the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. gave $30 billion in munitions; Canada also gave aid. (The American and Canadian aid did not have to be repaid, but there were also American loans that were repaid.)\nBritain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a \"people's war\" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.\nThe media called it a \"people's war\"—a term that caught on and signified the popular demand for planning and an expanded welfare state. The Royal family played major symbolic roles in the war. They refused to leave London during the Blitz and were indefatigable in visiting troops, munition factories, dockyards, and hospitals all over the country. All social classes appreciated how the royals shared the hopes, fears and hardships of the people.\n\n\n=== Mobilisation of women ===\n\nHistorians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.\nMuch of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. Women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment became clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep rats and mice under control.\nThe British relied successfully on voluntarism. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the area under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 acres (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.\n\n\n=== Welfare state ===\n\nThe success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. It was supported by the coalition government and all major parties. Welfare conditions, especially regarding food, improved during the war as the government imposed rationing and subsidized food prices. Conditions for housing, however, worsened with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply.\nEquality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.\nPeople demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices. The goal was operationalized in a famous report by William Beveridge. It recommended that the various income maintenance services that had grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.\n\n\n== Postwar ==\n\nBritain had won the war, but it lost India in 1947 and nearly all the rest of the Empire by the 1960s. It debated its role in world affairs and joined the United Nations in 1945, NATO in 1949, and became a close ally of the United States. Prosperity returned in the 1950s, and London remained a world centre of finance and culture, but the nation was no longer a major world power. In 1973, after a long debate and initial rejection, it joined the Common Market.\n\n\n=== Austerity, 1945–1950 ===\nThe end of the war saw a landslide victory for Clement Attlee and the Labour Party. They were elected on a manifesto of greater social justice with left-wing policies such as the creation of a National Health Service, more council housing and nationalisation of several major industries. Britain faced a severe financial crisis, and responded by reducing her international responsibilities and by sharing the hardships of an \"age of austerity\". Large loans from the United States and Marshall Plan grants helped rebuild and modernise its infrastructure and business practices. Rationing and conscription dragged on well into the post war years, and the country suffered one of the worst winters on record. Nevertheless, morale was boosted by events such as the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and the Festival of Britain in 1951.\n\n\n==== Nationalisation ====\nLabour Party experts went into the files to find the detailed plans for nationalisation. To their surprise, there were no plans. The leaders decided to act fast to keep up the momentum of the 1945 electoral landslide. They started with the Bank of England, civil aviation, coal, and Cable & Wireless. Then came railways, canals, road haulage and trucking, electricity, and gas. Finally came iron and steel, which was a special case because it was a manufacturing industry. Altogether, about one fifth of the economy was nationalised. Labour dropped its plans to nationalise farmlands. The procedure used was developed by Herbert Morrison, who as Lord President of the Council chaired the Committee on the Socialization of Industries. He followed the model that had already been used to establish public corporations such as the BBC (1927). In exchange for the shares, the owners of the companies were given government bonds paying low rates of interest, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, but they were now effectively civil servants working for the government.\nFor the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a way to consolidate economic planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure. There was no money for modernisation, although the Marshall Plan, operated separately by American planners, did force many British businesses to adopt modern managerial techniques. Hardline socialists were disappointed, as the nationalised industries seemed identical to the old private corporations, and national planning was made virtually impossible by the government's financial constraints. Socialism was in place, but it did not seem to make a major difference. Rank-and-file workers had long been motivated to support Labour by tales of the mistreatment of workers by foremen and the management. The foremen and the managers were the same people as before, with much the same power over the workplace. There was no worker control of industry. The unions resisted government efforts to set wages. By the time of the general elections in 1950 and 1951, Labour seldom boasted about nationalisation of industry. Instead it was the Conservatives who decried the inefficiency and mismanagement, and promised to reverse the takeover of steel and trucking.\n\n\n=== Prosperity of the postwar years ===\nAs the country headed into the 1950s, rebuilding continued and a number of immigrants from the remaining British Empire, mostly the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent, were invited to help the rebuilding effort. As the 1950s wore on, Britain lost its place as a superpower and could no longer maintain its large Empire. This led to decolonisation, and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970. Events such as the Suez Crisis showed that the UK's status had fallen in the world. The 1950s and 1960s were, however, relatively prosperous times after the Second World War, and saw the beginning of a modernisation of the UK, with the construction of its first motorways for example, and also during the 1960s a great cultural movement began which expanded across the world. Unemployment was relatively low during this period and the standard of living continued to rise with more new private and council housing developments taking place and the number of slum properties diminishing.\nThe postwar period also witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, as characterised by a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965. Earnings for men in industry rose by 95% between 1951 and 1964, while during that same period the official workweek was reduced and five reductions in income tax were made. Those in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. As summed up by R. J. Unstead,\n\nOpportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\nIn 1950, the UK standard of living was higher than in any EEC country apart from Belgium. It was 50% higher than the West German standard of living, and twice as high as the Italian standard of living. By the earlier Seventies, however, the UK standard of living was lower than all EEC countries apart from Italy (which, according to one calculation, was roughly equal to Britain). In 1951, the average weekly earnings of men over the age of 21 stood at £8 6s 0d, and nearly doubled a decade later to £15 7s 0d. By 1966, average weekly earnings stood at £20 6s 0d. Between 1964 and 1968, the percentage of households with a television set rose from 80.5% to 85.5%, a washing machine from 54% to 63%, a refrigerator from 35% to 55%, a car from 38% to 49%, a telephone from 21.5% to 28%, and central heating from 13% to 23%.\nBetween 1951 and 1963, wages rose by 72% while prices rose by 45%, enabling people to afford more consumer goods than ever before. Between 1955 and 1967, the average earnings of weekly-paid workers increased by 96% and those of salaried workers by 95%, while prices rose by about 45% in the same period. The rising affluence of the Fifties and Sixties was underpinned by sustained full employment and a dramatic rise in workers' wages. In 1950, the average weekly wage stood at £6.8s, compared with £11.2s.6d in 1959. As a result of wage rises, consumer spending also increased by about 20% during this same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, food rations were lifted in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.\nAs noted by Harriet Wilson,\n\nNational wealth has grown considerably, and although the shareout of this among the social classes has remained substantially of the same proportions, it has meant a considerable rise in the standard of living of all classes. It is estimated that in Britain at the turn of the century average earnings in industry sufficed merely to meet the essential needs of a two-child family, today average earnings allow the industrial wage-earner to spend a third of his income on things other than basic needs.\nThe significant real wage increases in the 1950s and 1960s contributed to a rapid increase in working-class consumerism, with British consumer spending rising by 45% between 1952 and 1964. In addition, entitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population. For the young and unattached, there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, Queen magazine declared that \"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\" Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan claimed that \"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\" Levels of disposable income rose steadily, with the spending power of the average family rising by 50% between 1951 and 1979, and by the end of the Seventies, 6 out of 10 families had come to own a car.\nAs noted by Martin Pugh,\n\nKeynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of £8 a week in 1951 to £15 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\nBy 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, 45% a washing machine, and 30% a refrigerator. In addition, as noted by John Burnett,\n\nWhat was equally striking was that ownership of such things had spread down the social scale and the gap between professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed.\nA study of a slum area in Leeds (which was due for demolition) found that 74% of the households had a television, 41% a vacuum, and 38% a washing machine. In another slum area, St Mary's in Oldham (where in 1970 few of the houses had fixed baths or a hot water supply and half shared outside toilets), 67% of the houses were rated as comfortably furnished and a further 24% furnished luxuriously, with smart modern furniture, deep pile carpeting, and decorations. \nThe provision of household amenities steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.\nBetween 1950 and 1970, however, Britain was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population (although Britain remained high in terms of bathrooms and lavatories per 100 people). Although the British standard of living was increasing, the standard of living in other countries increased faster. According to a 1968 study by Anthony Sampson, British workers:\n\nIn ten years, from having had a much higher standard of living than the continent, they have slipped right back. Taking the national income per head (a rough yardstick), the British by 1967 had sunk to eighth place among OECD countries, with an annual income of $1,910 compared with $2,010 for Germany, $2,060 for France and $2,480 for Switzerland: and Britain's falling position already shows itself in the lower proportion of new cars and new houses (though still leading with TV sets and washing machines).\"\nIn 1976, UK wages were amongst the lowest in Western Europe, being half of West German rates and two-thirds of Italian rates. In addition, while educational opportunities for working-class people had widened significantly since the end of the Second World War, a number of developed countries came to overtake Britain in some educational indicators. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan stayed in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils. In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom. There also remained gaps between manual and non-manual workers in areas such as fringe benefits and wage levels. In April 1978, for instance, male full-time manual workers aged 21 and above averaged a gross weekly wage of £80.70, while the equivalent for male white collar workers stood at £100.70.\n\n\n=== Empire to Commonwealth ===\n\nBritain's control over its Empire loosened during the interwar period. Nationalism strengthened in other parts of the empire, particularly in India and in Egypt.\nBetween 1867 and 1910, the UK had granted Australia, Canada, and New Zealand \"Dominion\" status (near complete autonomy within the Empire). They became charter members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (known as the Commonwealth of Nations since 1949), an informal but close-knit association that succeeded the British Empire. Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the remainder of the British Empire was almost completely dismantled. Today, most of Britain's former colonies belong to the Commonwealth, almost all of them as independent members. There are, however, 13 former British colonies, including Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, and others, which have elected to continue rule by London and are known as British Overseas Territories.\n\n\n=== From the Troubles to the Belfast Agreement ===\n\nIn the 1960s, moderate unionist Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill tried to reform the system and give a greater voice to Catholics who comprised 40% of the population of Northern Ireland. His goals were blocked by militant Protestants led by the Rev. Ian Paisley. The increasing pressures from nationalists for reform and from unionists to resist reform led to the appearance of the civil rights movement under figures like John Hume, Austin Currie and others. Clashes escalated out of control as the army could barely contain the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Ulster Defence Association. British leaders feared their withdrawal would give a \"Doomsday Scenario\", with widespread communal strife, followed by the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. London shut down Northern Ireland's parliament and began direct rule. By the 1990s, the failure of the IRA campaign to win mass public support or achieve its aim of a British withdrawal led to negotiations that in 1998 produced the 'Good Friday Agreement'. It won popular support and largely ended the Troubles.\n\n\n=== The economy in the late 20th century ===\n\nAfter the relative prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s, the UK experienced industrial strife and stagflation through the 1970s following a global economic downturn; Labour had returned to government in 1964 under Harold Wilson to end 13 years of Conservative rule. The Conservatives were restored to government in 1970 under Edward Heath, who failed to halt the country's economic decline and was ousted in 1974 as Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson. The economic crisis deepened following Wilson's return and things fared little better under his successor James Callaghan.\nA strict modernisation of its economy began under the controversial Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher following her election as prime minister in 1979, which saw a time of record unemployment as deindustrialisation saw the end of much of the country's manufacturing industries, but also a time of economic boom as stock markets became liberalised and state-owned industries were privatised. Her rise to power was seen as the symbolic end of the time in which the British economy had become the \"sick man\" of western Europe. Inflation also fell during this period and trade union power was reduced.\n\nHowever the miners' strike of 1984–1985 prefigured the end of most of the UK's coal mining. The exploitation of North Sea gas and oil brought in substantial tax and export revenues to aid the new economic boom. This was also the time that the IRA took the issue of Northern Ireland to Great Britain, maintaining a prolonged bombing campaign on the British mainland.\nAfter the economic boom of the 1980s a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992 following the economic chaos of Black Wednesday under government of John Major, who had succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. However the rest of the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over 16 years. It was  expanded under the so-called New Labour government of Tony Blair following his landslide election victory in 1997. The rejuvenated Labour party abandoned its commitment to policies including nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms. It emphasized an appeal to the better-educated voter.\nFrom 1964 up until 1996, income per head had doubled, while ownership of various household goods had significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer. In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties which lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders, and 47% had microwave ovens. Holiday entitlements had also become more generous. In 1990, nine out of ten full-time manual workers were entitled to more than four weeks of paid holiday a year, while twenty years previously only two-thirds had been allowed three weeks or more.\nThe postwar period also witnessed significant improvements in housing conditions. In 1960, 14% of British households had no inside toilet, while in 1967 22% of all homes had no basic hot water supply. By the 1990s, most homes had these amenities together with central heating. From 1996–1997 to 2006–2007, real median household income increased by 20% while real mean household incomes increased by 23%. There has also been a shift towards a service-based economy in the years following the end of the Second World War, with 11% of working people employed in manufacturing in 2006, compared with 25% in 1971.\n\n\n=== Common Market (EEC), then EU, membership ===\n\nBritain's wish to join the Common Market (as the European Economic Community was known in Britain) was first expressed in July 1961 by the Macmillan government. It was vetoed in 1963 by French President Charles de Gaulle. After initially hesitating over the issue, Harold Wilson's Labour Government lodged the UK's second application (in May 1967) to join the Community. Like the first, though, it was vetoed by de Gaulle.\nIn 1973, with de Gaulle gone, Conservative Prime Minister Heath negotiated terms for admission and Britain finally joined the Community. In opposition the Labour Party was deeply divided, though its Leader, Harold Wilson, remained in favour. In the 1974 General Election the Labour Party manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history. In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government (and the Conservative opposition) were free to present their views on either side of the question. A referendum was duly held on 5 June 1975, and the proposition to continue membership was passed with a substantial majority.\nThe Single European Act (SEA) was the first major revision of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. In 1987, the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher enacted it into UK law.\nThe Maastricht Treaty transformed the European Community into the European Union. In 1992, the Conservative government under John Major ratified it, against the opposition of his backbench Maastricht Rebels.\nThe Lisbon Treaty introduced many changes to the treaties of the Union. Prominent changes included more qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, increased involvement of the European Parliament in the legislative process through extended codecision with the Council of Ministers, eliminating the pillar system and the creation of a President of the European Council with a term of two and a half years and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to present a united position on EU policies. The Treaty of Lisbon made the Union's human rights charter, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty led to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the Council of the European Union from 8.4% to 12.4%. In July 2008, the Labour government under Gordon Brown approved the treaty and the Queen ratified it.\n\n\n=== Devolution for Scotland and Wales ===\n\nOn 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, a referendum was held on establishing a devolved Scottish Parliament. This resulted in an overwhelming 'yes' vote both to establishing the parliament and granting it limited tax varying powers. One week later, a referendum in Wales on establishing a Welsh Assembly was also approved but with a very narrow majority. The first elections were held, and these bodies began to operate in 1999. The creation of these bodies has widened the differences between the countries of the United Kingdom, especially in areas like healthcare. It has also brought to the fore the so-called West Lothian question which is a complaint that devolution for Scotland and Wales but not England has created a situation where Scottish and Welsh MPs in the UK Parliament can, in principle, vote on internal matters affecting England alone whereas English MPs have no say in similar matters affecting Scotland and Wales.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n\n=== War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War ===\n\nIn the 2001 General Election, the Labour Party won a second successive victory, though voter turnout dropped to the lowest level for 80 years. The September 11 attacks in the US led to President George W. Bush launching the War on terror, beginning with the invasion of Afghanistan aided by British troops in October 2001. Thereafter, with the US focus shifting to Iraq, Tony Blair convinced the Labour and Conservative MPs to vote in favour of supporting the 2003 invasion of Iraq, despite huge anti-war marches held in London and Glasgow. Forty-six thousand British troops, one-third of the total strength of the Army's land forces, were deployed to assist with the invasion and British forces were responsible for security in southern Iraq. All British forces were withdrawn in 2010.\nThe Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair won the 2005 British general election and a third consecutive term. On 7 July 2005, a series of four suicide bombings struck London, killing 52 commuters along with the four bombers, and injuring hundreds.\n\n\n=== Nationalist governments in Scotland ===\nFollowing the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) won their first victory. They formed a minority government with plans to hold a referendum before 2011 to seek a mandate \"to negotiate with the Government of the United Kingdom to achieve independence for Scotland.\" Unionist parties responded by establishing the Calman Commission to examine further devolution of powers, a position that had the support of the Prime Minister. Responding to the findings of the review, the UK government issued a white paper in 2009, on new powers that would be devolved to the Scottish Government, notably on how it can raise tax and carry out capital borrowing, and the running of Scottish Parliament elections. The proposal was criticised by UK opposition parties for not proposing to implement any changes before the next general election. The Calman Review white paper proposals fell short of what would normally be seen as requiring a referendum. These proposals would ultimately form the basis of the Scotland Act 2012.\nThe 2011 election saw a decisive victory for the SNP which was able to form a majority government intent on delivering a referendum on independence. Prime Minister David Cameron guaranteed that the UK government would not put any legal or political obstacles in the way of such a referendum.\n\n\n==== 2014 Scottish Independence referendum ====\n\nOn 18 September 2014, a referendum was held in Scotland on whether to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. The three UK-wide political parties—Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats—campaigned together as part of the Better Together campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the Yes Scotland campaign, together with the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued 'The Vow', a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom.\nFirst Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond resigned after the defeat, succeeded by Nicola Sturgeon. Advocating for a second referendum, she would lead the SNP to victory in the 2016 and 2021 elections.\n\n\n=== 2008 economic crisis ===\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, the economy contracted, experiencing recession throughout 2009. The announcement in 2008 that the economy had shrunk for the first time since 1992, ended 16 years of continuous economic growth. Causes included an end to the easy credit, reduction in consumption and substantial depreciation of sterling (which fell 25% against the euro between January 2008 and January 2009), leading to increased import costs, notably of oil.\nOn 8 October 2008, the British Government announced a bank rescue package of around £500 billion ($850 billion at the time). The plan comprised three parts: £200 billion to be made available to the banks in the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme; the Government was to increase the banks' market capitalization, through the Bank Recapitalization Fund, with an initial £25 billion and another £25 billion to be provided if needed; and the Government was to temporarily underwrite any eligible lending between British banks up to around £250 billion. With the UK officially coming out of recession in the fourth quarter of 2009—ending six consecutive quarters of economic decline—the Bank of England decided against further quantitative easing.\n\n\n=== 2010 coalition government ===\nThe 2010 general election resulted in the first hung parliament since 1974, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats, but falling short of the 326 seats required for a  majority. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats agreed to form the first coalition government for the UK since the Second World War, with David Cameron becoming Prime Minister and Nick Clegg Deputy Prime Minister.\nUnder the coalition, British military aircraft participated in the UN-mandated intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war, flying 3,000 air sorties against forces loyal to dictator Muammar Gaddafi. 2011 saw England suffer unprecedented rioting in its major cities in August, killing five and causing over £200 million worth of damage.\nIn October 2011, the prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms voted to grant gender equality in the royal succession, ending the male-preference primogeniture mandated by the Act of Settlement 1701. The amendment, once enacted, ended the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic.\n\n\n=== 2015 election ===\nThe 2015 election was held on 7 May 2015 with pre-election polls all predicting a close race and hung parliament. The surprising result was a clear victory by the Conservative Party: with 37% of the popular vote, they won a narrow majority in parliament with 331 of the 650 seats. The other most significant result was the Scottish National Party winning all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland. This was because of a surge in support for the SNP following the 2014 independence referendum, and SNP party membership had quadrupled from 25,000 to over 100,000, meaning that 1 in every 50 of the population of Scotland was a party member.\nLabour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and losing 40 of its 41 seats in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats lost 49 of their 57 seats, as they were punished for their decision to form a coalition with the conservatives. The UK Independence Party (UKIP), rallying voters against the EU and uncontrolled immigration, secured 13% and came second in over 115 races, but won only one seat in parliament. Cameron had a mandate for his austerity policies to shrink the size of government, and a challenge in dealing with Scotland. Likewise the Green Party of England and Wales saw a rise in support but retained just its one seat.\n\n\n=== 2016 EU membership referendum ===\n\nIn February 2016, Prime Minister Cameron announced that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union would be held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by eurosceptics. Debates and campaigns by parties supporting both \"Remain\" (Britain Stronger in Europe) and \"Leave\" (Vote Leave) focused on concerns regarding trade and the European single market, security, migration and sovereignty. The result of the referendum was in favour of the country leaving the EU with 51.9% of voters wanting to leave. Cameron resigned, which led to Theresa May succeeding him as Prime Minister.\nThe UK remained a member of the EU, but invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in March 2017. This started negotiations on a withdrawal agreement to last no more than two years, before an exit from the EU (Brexit) intended for March 2019 but later extended to October, then again to early 2020.\nThe debate on Brexit grew heated. During the 2016 campaign on the referendum, Boris Johnson became a leading proponent of Vote Leave, stating, \"The EU is, I'm afraid a job-destroying engine. You can see it all across southern Europe, you can see it, alas, in our country\". A victory for Brexit, he argued, would be \"independence day\" for Britain if it leaves the European Union. By 2019, Johnson was Prime Minister and pushed hard for an exit on 31 October 2019. The opponents warned of bedlam. Political commentator Jonathan Freedland argued in late summer 2019 that the Britain was, \"in the grip of a populism that is trampling on the norms and constraints of liberal democracy, that is contemplating a collective act of self-harm without precedent, that is bracing itself for disruption, shortages, even civil unrest unknown in peacetime. This is not the consequence of unavoidable war or an unforeseen natural disaster, but is entirely of the country's own making.\"\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nThough later reporting indicated there may have been cases dating from late 2019, COVID-19 was confirmed to be spreading in the UK by the end of January 2020 with the first confirmed deaths in March. The country was initially relatively slow in implementing restrictions. Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over 1000 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 entered the UK in early 2020 from international travellers, mostly from outbreaks elsewhere in Europe, leading to clusters that overwhelmed contact tracing efforts. A legally enforced lockdown was introduced on 23 March. Restrictions were eased in late spring and early summer. The UK's epidemic in early 2020 was one of the largest and deadliest worldwide.\n\nBy the Autumn, cases were again rising. This led to the creation of new regulations along with the introduction of the concept of a local lockdown, a variance in restrictions in a more specific geographic location than the four nations of the UK. Lockdowns took place in Wales, England and Northern Ireland later that season. A new variant of the virus is thought to have originated in Kent around September 2020. Once restrictions were lifted, the novel variant rapidly spread across the UK. Its increased transmissibility contributed to a continued increase in infections. The NHS had come under severe strain by late December. This led to a tightening of restrictions.\nThe first COVID-19 vaccine was approved and began its rollout in the UK in early December 2020. 15 million vaccine doses had been given to predominantly those most vulnerable by mid-February. 6 months later more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID. Restrictions began to ease from late February and almost all had ended in Britain by August. A third wave of daily infections began in July 2021 due to the arrival and spread of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. However, mass vaccination continued to keep deaths and hospitalisations at much lower levels than previous waves. During the third COVID wave, in the light of highly transmissible Omicron variant, the UK was also the acclaim of a new hybrid strain, Deltacron variant, which pre-dominated the country until April 2022 ahead of the endemic phase alongside Ireland, Finland, Cyprus, Slovenia, Croatia, and others.\n\n\n=== Government crises and Sunak Ministry (2022–2024) ===\n\nIn 2022, the UK government faced multiple crises. The Partygate scandal, involving lockdown rule breaches by government officials, led to 126 fixed penalty notices, including for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. Johnson faced calls to resign, and after further scandals like the Chris Pincher scandal, he stepped down in July 2022. Liz Truss succeeded Johnson but her government quickly faced turmoil. Her September mini-budget triggered market instability, leading to the dismissal of Kwasi Kwarteng and Truss's resignation in October.\nRishi Sunak became the first Asian Prime Minister on 25 October 2022. While Sunak promised stability after the crises, his premiership saw historically low approval ratings for the Conservative Party, consistently polling below the Labour Party under new leader Keir Starmer, who was seen as a moderate compared to his socialist predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. The Conservatives lost votes to Reform UK, a populist right-wing party hard on immigration, contributing to their worst election performance in history.\n\n\n=== Labour government (2024–present) ===\nOn 4 July 2024, the Labour Party won a landslide victory in general election after 14 years of Conservative rule, meaning Labour Party leader Keir Starmer became Britain's new prime minister. Following the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, misinformation spread falsely accusing the perpetrator as being a Muslim, sparking the 2024 United Kingdom riots as a backlash against immigration to the UK in general, especially from Islamic countries.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Historiography ===\n\n\n=== Primary sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to History of the United Kingdom at Wikimedia Commons\nContemporary British History\nFirst World War Studies \nTwentieth Century British History\nHistory of Education: Journal of the History of Education Society\nTimelines: Sources from history – British Library interactive\nInfo Britain.co.uk\nHistory of the United Kingdom: Primary Documents\nBritish History online\nText of 1800 Act of Union\nAct of Union virtual library Archived 14 August 2011 at the Wayback Machine\nVision of Britain",
      "summary": "The history of the United Kingdom begins in 1707 with the Treaty of Union and Acts of Union. The core of the United Kingdom as a unified state came into being with the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, into a new unitary state called Great Britain. Of this new state, the historian Simon Schama said:\n\nWhat began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\nThe Acts of Union 1800 added the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe first decades were marked by Jacobite risings which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In 1763, victory in the Seven Years' War led to the growth of the First British Empire. With defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, Great Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa. As a result, British culture, and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide. Politically the central event was the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury. Culturally, the Victorian era was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century from 1815 to 1914. The First World War, with Britain in alliance with France, Russia and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting League of Nations was a favourite project in Interwar Britain. However, while the Empire remained strong, as did the London financial markets, the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and, especially, the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitler's Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 started the Second World War. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the US joined the UK as the main Allied powers.\nBritain was no longer a military or economic superpower, as seen in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Britain no longer had the wealth to maintain an empire, so it granted independence to almost all its possessions. The new states typically joined the Commonwealth of Nations. The postwar years saw great hardships, alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the United States, and some from Canada. Prosperity returned in the 1950s. Meanwhile, from 1945 to 1950, the Labour Party built a welfare state, nationalized many industries, and created the National Health Service. The UK took a strong stand against Communist expansion after 1945, playing a major role in the Cold War and the formation of NATO as an anti-Soviet military alliance with West Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Canada and smaller countries. NATO remains a powerful military coalition. The UK has been a leading member of the United Nations since its founding, as well as numerous other international organizations. In the 1990s, neoliberalism led to the privatisation of nationalised industries and significant deregulation of business affairs. London's status as a world financial hub grew continuously. Since the 1990s, large-scale devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have decentralised political decision-making. Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. It joined the European Economic Community in 1973, thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. However, the Brexit referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the European Union, which it did in 2020.\nIn 1922, 26 counties of Ireland seceded to become the Irish Free State; a day later, Northern Ireland seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its formal title to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to Britain and (after 1945) to the United Kingdom or UK.\n\n",
