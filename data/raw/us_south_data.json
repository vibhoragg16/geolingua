I was surprised to hear him say that he lives in Charlotte, and at the end of the interview, he drops his email address, and basically says, \"Reach out if you're looking for a percussionist! I wanna play!\" \n\nThe interview is great. I've always thought that he seems like such a charismatic, fun person to be around. So I hope someone will hire him for a gig, so that I can see him play out and about and come dance at your gigs! \n\nInterview link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g4ShUOJl3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g4ShUOJl3Q)\n\nSteve in action (in the 1980s... but I bet he still brings it) : \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfr3L0drhS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfr3L0drhS8) \n\n  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL2IkJ1P\\_H0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL2IkJ1P_H0)\n\n",

        "selftext": "I got a lot of pictures and was tagged in a lot of photos of this very isolated thunderstorm or cumulonimbus cloud last night. This was a single storm southeast of Charlotte. People saw the \"mushroom\" shaped clouds and were mystified, but this is just what every single thunderstorm looks like if it were all alone. When cumulonimbus clouds grow high enough, the updraft hits the top of the lower atmosphere and spreads out along the tropopause. This then becomes an anvil or a mushroom shape, forming what is a textbook thunderstorm. I think many people just think of what thunderstorms look like from below, dark and menacing, but from above or at a distance, they appear bright white and resemble developing cauliflower heads, then transform into anvil-shaped and mushroom-shaped clouds.[ ](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cltwx?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVE389mmOgGAys3pnGH9B-z3oKlJ5rdwDDJfplZsYLf48V0oRlvQ0O8j6Ttw4klTA8_STa5vageq2WyE_L4axD2Z7HI-xkBFiEBfGxM2LPCD5jsShbrV4hiAB1yUKNuJW71jPSq0Lyfle06fbAJcB9DAyRNKLRA_p9nT_ViGbBeMguz8HVu5Xz-pjc4dsI_ZfAii8o4WFzZz72GK1A_fqzI&__tn__=*NK-R)",

        "selftext": "This monthly thread is for you to post about your own small business. We notice that there are plenty of small business owners in this city who are trying to make it. New Orleans is a city full of hustlers and we should celebrate that. I'll put some bullet points below on the rules for these comments and you should read them before commenting about your business. This thread will post automatically posted on the 9th of every month and replace the \"Monthly Local Discoveries\" thread. It will be up for 1 week and be replaced by the \"Jobs\" weekly thread.\n\nThe mods will reserve the right to remove any business posting if it breaks any rules or if we feel that it's being gamed in any kind of way. This is for small business, not for national marketing companies or global chains. *If your business posting gets removed, please message us via modmail and we will be more than happy to explain why and have a conversation.* \n\n\n\n* Comment in this thread ONLY. No business promotion posts will be allowed on the sub for any reason OTHER than on this monthly thread.\n* Small business in this thread means a staff of 10 or less. If you think your company should be an exception, please send us a modmail and we can discuss.\n* The mod team HIGHLY SUGGESTS that you create a new business account, have it be active for more than 2 weeks and have a positive karma score. If you want to promote your business via your normal account, that may not be the brightest decision you've ever made. If you go this route, try to have the username be indicative of your business. \n* Keep these businesses SFW. If you have a sexy-time kind of business, please be discreet. We're thinking if you sell toys, accessories, lotions etc. **NO ONLY FANS ACCOUNTS, SEX WORKERS OR \"SERVICES\" ALLOWED.** \n* If you have more than one location, you're not a small business and need to check with us via modmail before posting.\n* Business owners and employees should NOT spam, message or harass users in any way. You are allowed one comment per thread, per month. Yes, you may answer questions about your business but you can't try to post from multiple accounts about the same business.\n* Make your business comment informative, smart and transparent. \n* Your business should be in Orleans, Jefferson, St. Tammany or Da Paaaarish. \n* **NO MLM, PONZI SCHEME, PYRMAID SCHEME, GET RICH QUICK type of posts.** This is a 100% firm stance. If you don't think that your business is one of these above listed types but have doubts, it probably is. \n* No churches or religious based businesses. This isn't the place for that, sorry.\n* This is a serious thread, so please keep the jokes and memes to a minimum.\n* Please be kind to the business owners here. This is not a thread to bash businesses. If you do not agree or like the business that is posted, just downvote it. If it breaks a rule, report it. No need for drama.\n\nThanks,\n\nThe MGT",

        "title": "New Orleans councilmember against facial recognition expansion",
        "selftext": "The vote on whether New Orleans police should have expanded access to live facial recognition has been delayed again. The proposed ordinance, now set to go before the Crime and Justice Committee on **July 31** and to the full City Council on **August 7,** would allow NOPD to use its own real-time system rather than relying solely on Project NOLA’s camera network.\n\nFollowing WDSU’s investigation into how facial recognition tools are currently used in the city, **Councilmember JP Morrell** is now speaking out. He said he plans to vote no and immigration concerns are at the center of his opposition.**\n\n“Now, throughout this ordinance, there is a tremendous amount of language which adds additional restrictions, such as it cannot be used to check someone's immigration status,” Morrell said. “I know this is kind of where NOPD and the authors are hanging their hat, to say this isn't about immigration.”\n\n**But Morrell argues those protections could be undermined by a new state law.**\n\n“Act 399 of this last legislative session by Senator Jay Morris essentially, he created a new crime,” Morrell said. “If an elected official or a government official does not cooperate with ICE.”\n\n**That law is set to go into effect August 1, just days before the City Council votes on the ordinance.** It creates a new form of malfeasance for any official who refuses to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nCivil liberties advocates say those legal pressures could make facial recognition data vulnerable to federal use even if city leaders say otherwise.\n\n“I mean, I don't know about you,” said a representative from the ACLU of Louisiana, **“but I don't necessarily trust that the federal government,** if they came in and wanted to look at this, look at these records and this data, that they would be using it in a good way. I don't think... maybe **Jeff Landry** wouldn't be looking at it in such a great way either.”\n\nPolice leadership maintains that immigration status is not and will not be part of NOPD operations.\n\n“For our city ordinances, we do not involve... our officers are not allowed to even inquire about someone's immigration status,” said the New Orleans police chief. “That is a topic of concern, I understand, for everyone. But New Orleans police we do not inquire about immigration status. I am way more concerned about those who are victims, who may be undocumented.”\n\nThe city’s facial recognition capabilities currently rely heavily on Project NOLA, a nonprofit that works with private camera hosts across the metro area. Its founder, Bryan Lagarde, says their camera network cannot and will not be used for immigration enforcement.\n\n“The simple reason why is because I can’t. Camera hosts don’t allow it,” Lagarde said. “Our front camera hosts give us permission to use the cameras in felony investigations, missing people. They do not give us permission to use facial recognition for immigration matters.”\n\nLagarde said the system can only be used if someone is wanted for a serious violent crime like shooting, stabbing, rape, robbery or home invasion.\n\n“If it’s just somebody who’s been in the country forever and, you know, they’re on a list,” he said, “we don’t help with that.”\n\nAs concerns grow around how expanding the use of this technology could affect undocumented residents, Councilmember Morrell says the debate must include the bigger picture.\n\n*\"“Why would I put two things in front of you?” Morrell asked. “There’s the city ordinance that says, ‘Don’t use it for immigration.’ And then there’s a state law that says, ‘If you don’t cooperate with ICE, you go to jail.’”**\n\n**The City Council will revisit the issue at the end of July.**",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy wife and I recently relocated to New Orleans from out of state for work and were really excited to get settled. Unfortunately, we’ve run into a major housing issue and could use some legal guidance. We signed a lease for an apartment with a move-in date of June 1 and paid rent and deposit upfront. A couple of weeks before we were supposed to move in, the leasing agent contacted us and said the current tenants weren’t going to be out on time. We were obviously frustrated but decided to stay flexible and agreed to a new move-in date of July 1, which we signed in an official lease addendum.\n\nThen, just three days before the new move-in, we were told again that the unit would not be available. This time, we were told the current tenants weren’t moving out until the end of July. We ended up contacting the current tenants directly, and they said they had no idea any of this was happening, no one had communicated anything to them, and their lease was always ending on July 31.\n\nSo, essentially, the landlord signed a lease with us while already having another lease active through the same period, and didn’t inform the existing tenants or us until the very last minute.\n\nBecause of this:\n\n* We had to put all our belongings into storage and temporarily move in with family out of state.\n* We’ve had to work remotely under very difficult circumstances.\n* We’ve incurred costs for storage, extended rent elsewhere, and relocation logistics.\n* Our plans to settle in the city have been completely upended.\n\nNow the landlord is offering to refund just the rent and deposit, but no compensation for the additional losses and disruption we’ve suffered.\n\nWe’re wondering:\n\n1. Do we have grounds to pursue damages beyond just the refund, given that we never got access to the unit?\n2. Would this qualify for small claims court in New Orleans?\n3. Is the landlord’s failure to deliver possession twice a clear breach of the lease?\n\nWe have the original lease, the signed addendum, texts/emails from the leasing agent, and even written confirmation from the current tenants that they were never informed.\n\nAny insight would be incredibly helpful, especially from anyone familiar with Louisiana or New Orleans rental law. Thank you so much.",

But it is absurd to charge $1 to add parmesan to your pizza or pasta dish. Parmesan is the cost of doing business in an Italian restaurant! Write it into your overhead! \n\n\nOf COURSE I can afford the extra dollar—I’m eating out, I’m tipping at minimum 20%, I can afford an up charge. But it’s simply the principle of the thing. An Italian restaurant in the US cannot charge for parmesan; that violates a universal unspoken code. \n\n\nThank you for reading. Go eat out, tip well, and may the parmesan gods smile upon you. ",

        "selftext": "[Paywalls suck: ](https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/keith_spera/lauryn-hill-closes-2025-essence-fest-late-in-empty-superdome/article_d233d232-36ba-4c73-8348-cbf064900f94.html#tncms-source=featured-top) Here is a summary:\n\n# Lauryn Hill Closes Essence Fest at 3:37 a.m. — to a Nearly Empty Superdome\n\nThe 2025 Essence Festival of Culture opened with a night that became one of the **most delayed and poorly executed in its 31-year history**, culminating with **Lauryn Hill taking the stage at 2:31 a.m.** and ending her set at **3:37 a.m.**, well after the Superdome had emptied out.\n\nEarlier in the night, R&B legend **Babyface**, clearly exhausted, admitted to being \"tired as hell\" by midnight — but he wasn’t alone. The night was already running late by then, with performances delayed from the very beginning. **Psyrin**, the R&B trio that opened, started the cascade of late acts. **Lucky Daye** and **Coco Jones** offered quick sets over pre-recorded tracks, barely making an impression.\n\n**GloRilla**, fourth in a lineup of **eight main stage performers** (at least two too many), ran long and pushed the schedule back even further. Her energetic set, complete with tight pink outfits, full choreography, and literal middle fingers, wrapped 45 minutes after the **Isley Brothers** were supposed to begin.\n\nThe Isleys tried to counter the lack of live music so far by cranking up their volume well past the point of clarity. “That Lady” became a sonic assault, but they pulled things back with classics like “Footsteps in the Dark.” Ronald Isley, regal in a bedazzled tuxedo jacket, alternated between standing and sitting but retained presence. Ernie Isley performed his usual guitar theatrics, playing behind his back and with his teeth.\n\n**Maxwell’s set didn’t start until 12:55 a.m.**, delivering 40 minutes of smooth soul. His band even paid tribute to New Orleans with a live cover of Rebirth Brass Band’s “Let’s Go Get ’Em.” Still, by the end of his set, the night felt interminable.\n\nAlthough Hill’s equipment appeared ready by 2:04 a.m., her band didn’t begin until 2:31. The audience at that point had thinned dramatically — the Dome, never more than half full all night, was nearly vacant.\n\nHill was a late addition to the lineup, announced just two days prior, and arguably delivered the most **substantial and musically dynamic** set of the evening. Her performance included full video content, a horn-driven live band, and personal touches: she bantered with fans, fulfilled spontaneous song requests like “I Gotta Find Peace of Mind,” and brought her sons Zion and Joshua “YG” Marley on stage.\n\nShe offered standout renditions of “To Zion,” “Killing Me Softly,” and “Doo Wop (That Thing),” the latter of which she restarted multiple times until it hit the right groove. She wrapped up the night with “Fu-Gee-La” and a shout of “Love you, Essence!” before exiting at **3:37 a.m.** — to an arena of just a few hundred remaining diehards.\n\nThe scheduling fiasco left fans angry and exhausted, and even Superdome staff affected. Hill’s powerful set was undercut by a festival schedule so delayed that few were left to witness it.\n\nIronically, while controversy had swirled in the days prior about the revived **Superlounge** stage being limited to **premium VVIP ticket holders**, by the time Hill performed, the **entire Superdome had the vibe of a Superlounge** — intimate, echoey, and eerily empty.\n\nEssence organizers offered no immediate explanation for the disastrous timing. But if opening night was meant to be a celebration of culture, what fans got instead was a **4 a.m. ghost show** — with star talent squandered by **overbooking, poor planning, and unchecked delays**.",

        "title": "Mayor LaToya Cantrell vetoes $20M deal with Tulane for Charity Hospital renovations",
        "selftext": "Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Monday vetoed $20 million New Orleans had promised for renovations to Charity Hospital, deepening a feud over the city's right to proceeds from a donated swath of oil-rich Louisiana coastline.\n\nThe city's $20 million pledge to Tulane University, which plans to turn the long-vacant Depression-era hospital into a new research center, emerged from negotiations over who should receive proceeds from the 38,000-acre plot around Port Fourchon, which is owned by the Wisner Trust. Tulane is one of several legacy recipients of proceeds from that land.\n\nLate philanthropist Edward Wisner donated the land to New Orleans in 1914.\n\nBut for years, Cantrell resisted attempts by the City Council to solidify city control over around $9 million the plot generates each year. She has sided with Wisner's descendants, fighting to maintain a system that gave the mayor and a private panel broad authority to divvy up the proceeds among a list of longstanding recipients, including the heirs, the city, Tulane, LSU and the Salvation Army.\n\nThe council's $20 million pledge followed a judge's order in late May identifying the city as the trust's sole recipient. It formed part of a broader deal meant to end the legal feud and solidify plans for renovations to Charity Hospital, which has sat vacant since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nOn Monday, though, Cantrell said she was vetoing legislation containing the funding pledge because it represents \"another attempt by the City Council to usurp executive authority.\" The payment risks \"depriving funding from multiple projects impacting the quality of life for New Orleanians,\" she wrote in a veto letter.\n\nThe City Council can override Cantrell's veto. All seven members praised the May ruling that ended the previous revenue-sharing agreement.\n\nStill, the mayor's decision illustrates the acrid tenor of the legal spat between the council and the mayor over who controls the proceeds of the Wisner Trust. And it underscores broader discord that has animated Cantrell's second term, during which council members have routinely accused her of mismanagement and the mayor, in turn, has claimed the city's legislative branch is unfairly attacking her authority.\n\n\"This veto does not make sense either for New Orleanians or the city's future health,\" Council member Joe Giarrusso said Monday in a  statement. \"The council members understood what was at stake, were all co-authors of the vetoed ordinance, and chose to support a vital economic development project that is in (Council) District B but will benefit the entire city.  We will take up the veto in due course.\"\n\nUnder its agreement with Tulane, the city would provide $20 million for the explicit purpose of renovating the Charity Hospital building. The project aims to anchor the university's downtown medical school with labs, offices, apartments and retail space. Tulane officials have estimated the new facility would create 2,300 jobs.\n\nThe city's pledge would cover only a fraction of the facility's full cost: Renovating the hulking hospital is estimated to carry a price tag of $650 million.\n\nA Tulane spokesperson declined to comment Monday on Cantrell's veto.\n\nThe City Council and Cantrell have been at odds over the Wisner Trust since 2022, when the council sued after learning that Cantrell had quietly extended the decades-old income sharing agreement with the previous beneficiaries.\n\nThe mayor did so in defiance of a 2014 court which found that the trust's old structure had expired, the council's lawyers argued. They contended that the proceeds now belonged solely to the city, and moved to block money from going to any of the defendants — including Tulane — while the lawsuit was pending.\n\nWhen a judge ruled in the council's favor in May, Cantrell appealed that decision. In doing so, she again sided with dozens of Wisner’s heirs, who contend they have interests in the land despite the 2014 ruling.\n\nCantrell's veto drew backlash from City Council President JP Morrell, who has emerged as one of the mayor's sharpest critics during her second term.\n\n“The mayor has consistently taken the side of greedy, out-of-state heirs over the people of New Orleans, who need this revenue stream,” Morrell said in an interview.\n\nA spokesperson for the Wisner heirs declined to comment.\n\n",

        "title": "Talked to a Firefighter Today",
        "selftext": "I talked to a friend who is in AFD this morning about the mess that is happening between the Union and their Fire Chief. The biggest takeaway I got from my friend is that the firefighters are distraught that the message has been hijacked, and that this has turned into an issue of race, especially on social media.\n\nHe specifically mentioned how embarrassing it was to see people like Charlie Kirk and other right wing nut bags twisting the issue, and flat out turning this into a racial issue. He said it now feels like a war between racists saying the Chief is a DEI hire vs people saying the firefighters are only blaming the Chief because he is black. It's all disgusting, and if there is one message he could get to the public it would be that your everyday firefighters are sorry this is what it has become.\n\nIf anyone has gotten this far, and is interested, this is my best summary of what he told me the underlying issues are. \n\nThe City is pinching public safety organizations financially. EMS is already shutting down units regularly, and there have been threats about doing the same to the fire department. It's not good for anyone, and there is a general feeling in public safety that the city cares more about their pet projects than keeping people safe.\n\nThe fire department is facing budget cuts like everyone else, and there are obviously strong feelings about that. Here is where the divide between the Chief and his firefighters begins. Supposedly the Chief has said \"I work for the city, not for the fire department\". So it seems there has been a line drawn. The Chief is a budget manager and a political figure, not a boots on the ground firefighter.\n\nEarlier this year the department was told that they needed to find ways to cut costs. One of the things that got shut down by the Fire Chief was deployments, which is an agreement departments make that if something horrible happens they will show up to help. This has been done for everything from 9/11 to major California wildfires.\n\nThis is important because that is where the breakdown happened. Essentially, it was known that bad storms were coming and surrounding areas began the process of preparing their teams to help where needed. Austin had already shut down this line of communication via the Chief's standing order that AFD was not helping with deployments. \n\nSo messages to prepare teams for help came in before the storms and AFD was forced to ignore them due to a standing order. More messages came in and again were left unanswered. My friend acknowledged that no one knew how bad this was going to be, and no one should be insinuating they did. The problem is those lines of communication should never have been shut down and things should have instead been handled on a case by case basis.\n\n When things started getting really bad firefighters were eventually forced to break protocol and essentially start begging to help via text messages and other informal routes. This is when AFD started sending swimmers and other resources.\n\nSo here is the fight in a nutshell. The firefighters understand the budget constraints, and were trying to follow orders, but they believed that if a major disaster hit close to home the people in charge would do the right thing and open the channels of communication necessary to mobilize the necessary resources. That unfortunately didn't happen until people started going around the road blocks put in place to beg for help. \n\n\nMy friend said that there are undoubtedly people higher on the political spectrum who share the blame for forcing these restraints, but they are untouchable, and if the Chief is essentially the political figure who represents the department then it is his job to express those issues and not allow these failures to happen. As such, the firefighters feel that the Chief is more prone to protect the City's interests and finances than the public well being. \n\nThat is where the vote of no confidence comes in. The firefighters feel that if the Chief has to choose between making a stand on behalf of the public and his firefighters or the city and their money he will choose the city and their financial interests first. \n\nThank you if you took the time to read all of that. Our conversation this morning was pretty informative and emotional, so I thought I'd share it here while it was still fresh. Again, if there is one single point I can get across, please know that your firefighters working at your local station hate how twisted and disgusting this fight has become. They just want to help people, and they are just as disgusted as everyone else by the sick twists and turns this has taken already.",

I hate the BBastardBill as much as the next sane person, but when you hear of kids waking up in chin deep water, you very quickly snap out of red vs blue and understand your duty as a human.  If you can't do that, please refrain from commenting\n\nEdit 2:   Somehow folks are thinking this post is political, apologies for that.  Early on this thread was raided with \"bootstrap\" and \"get what they voted for\" crusaders.  My edit was specifically meant for those people.  This IS NOT political.  Kids are missing, people are missing, people died..... this is tragic \n\nEdit 3:   I've been through two massive floods as an adult.  I've broken down several times today just imagining what these babies went through.  My heart is shattered and this 4th will never be normal.  I'm absolutely devastated.  ",

I'll get there a little early to put out signs so you know where to find us. I will also have Table Topics, Cards Against Humanity, and name tags. You don't have to wear a name tag if you don't want to, and you don't have to share your Reddit username! Add a sticker to your name tag to indicate if you're new to Birmingham - this will be a great way to start conversations with strangers (very scary!)\n\nSunday morning I'll make one final post and give a description of what I'm wearing so you can come and find me if you are coming solo and need a \"first friend\" to talk to. I will try to monitor Reddit during the event so if you have questions you can leave a comment or DM me.\n\nHope to see you all there!",

        "selftext": "The drag bar & taqueria that was set to open in Five Points this month fired their entire managerial staff yesterday because they’ve run out of money, according to former staff. Hired serving/bartending staff received this email from front of house today:\n\n“Do not quit your [current] job, they have run out of money and were not even planning on being truthful with you all. They were inviting you all to work without any money or licensing. I am so sorry”\n\nShortly followed by this email from the owners: \n\n“Hello Everyone—\n\nI have some unfortunate news to share with you all. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we have to revoke your offer letters at this time. We have encountered some difficulties that will cause us to not be able to open when we originally thought. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience this has caused each of you. When we have more information on a new opening date, we will reach out to see if you are still interested in joining the team here at Opulence. \n\nIf you have any questions, you can reach out to me directly here at this email. \n\n- Scott Charby” (service@opulencedraglounge.com)\n\nThe owners are from out of state, and upon arrival, the LGBTQ+ community was excited and hopeful about a new queer venue. Some folks were weary, as businesses in Five Points are notorious for going under quickly and out-of-state folks often don’t have a good understanding of how the community functions. \n\nIt’s unclear what exactly is the cause of this sudden news. Based on communication from managerial staff, it seems to be because the owners have run out of money and still lack proper licensing to operate as a bar in Alabama. \n\nThey just sent offer letter out to serving and bartending staff last week. I find it hard to believe that they didn’t know their financial situation and potentially negative outcome of the business last week. \n\nThe managerial staff had already quit their previous job and have been on payroll for a month or longer. \n\nNot only is this a slap in the face to the Birmingham entertainment scene—it’s a slap in the face to our LGBTQ+ community. We were promised so much by people who aren’t from here and don’t know us… we were hesitant, and still decided to trust them… and now we’re here. ",

I’d love to find circles or friendships rooted in meaningful conversation, shared values, and that soft, grounded feminine energy. \n\nAlso open to recommendations on places to hang out — cozy cafes, bookstores, yoga studios, art spots, farmers markets — anywhere that feels welcoming and intentional.\n\nWould love to connect if this resonates 💛\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\nEDIT: \nY’all… I have chills. The amount of support, kindness, and shared energy in this thread has completely blown me away. I was nervous to even post, and now my heart feels so full. Truly — thank you.\n\nI won’t be back in town for a few months, but I’d love to keep this connection going. \n\nI created a space for progressive, heart-centered women around Bham to stay in touch, share ideas, and eventually meet up 🌿 --- ask to join here https://www.facebook.com/groups/birminghamsisterhoodcircle/ ",

        "selftext": "The drag bar & taqueria that was set to open in Five Points this month fired their entire managerial staff yesterday because they’ve run out of money, according to former staff. Hired serving/bartending staff received this email from front of house today:\n\n“Do not quit your [current] job, they have run out of money and were not even planning on being truthful with you all. They were inviting you all to work without any money or licensing. I am so sorry”\n\nShortly followed by this email from the owners: \n\n“Hello Everyone—\n\nI have some unfortunate news to share with you all. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we have to revoke your offer letters at this time. We have encountered some difficulties that will cause us to not be able to open when we originally thought. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience this has caused each of you. When we have more information on a new opening date, we will reach out to see if you are still interested in joining the team here at Opulence. \n\nIf you have any questions, you can reach out to me directly here at this email. \n\n- Scott Charby” (service@opulencedraglounge.com)\n\nThe owners are from out of state, and upon arrival, the LGBTQ+ community was excited and hopeful about a new queer venue. Some folks were weary, as businesses in Five Points are notorious for going under quickly and out-of-state folks often don’t have a good understanding of how the community functions. \n\nIt’s unclear what exactly is the cause of this sudden news. Based on communication from managerial staff, it seems to be because the owners have run out of money and still lack proper licensing to operate as a bar in Alabama. \n\nThey just sent offer letter out to serving and bartending staff last week. I find it hard to believe that they didn’t know their financial situation and potentially negative outcome of the business last week. \n\nThe managerial staff had already quit their previous job and have been on payroll for a month or longer. \n\nNot only is this a slap in the face to the Birmingham entertainment scene—it’s a slap in the face to our LGBTQ+ community. We were promised so much by people who aren’t from here and don’t know us… we were hesitant, and still decided to trust them… and now we’re here. ",

I'm an attorney, but I don't do intenional torts cases. \n\nIf you're only suing the perpetrator, there's a substantial difficulty in recovering anything. Most individuals lack the insurance and assets to cover a judgment that large. The existence of a parallel criminal case can also complicate things.\n\nIf you've not called anyone yet, I would start with Buckley Bala Wilson and Mew. They're one of the best plaintiff's firms in the state, and they have a practice division in SA cases. If they aren't able to take you on,  they should have a good idea of what your options are and what steps to take next.",

If these subcontractors have negative track records such as in our instance where their job said it was gonna take six weeks and they took over six months and forgot part of it as I have proof in an email, will they no longer be awarded city contracts? In addition, there is no current program with the city to help offset the economic disruption to businesses when these poorly managed street projects occur. What are your thoughts on forming a program that uses grant money when road projects extend beyond their projected timelines creating a negative fiscal situation for businesses  affected by mismanaged road project?  \n\nIn addition, the head of public works department informed me in an email that road construction was a necessary part of improving quality of life and they can be inconvenient. I would say that a six week project that ballooned to six months and prevented anybody from the Taylor Swift concert or the Super Bowl coming to our shop is a bit more than an inconvenience. What are the methods for getting a new person in who actually cares about the city, the businesses that are affected by his poorly mismanaged projects, or even some sort of checks and balances for that department so that they all know what's going on?Because the email thread that I'm on shows five people all with conflicting information, all who don't know what's going on.In addition the councilwoman and project manager never came to the site as we were promised. What are your thoughts on how to clean up the gross mismanagement of this department?",

Over two hours you will mix up to three fragrance oils (like blood orange, salt air, violet, lime and more) to create a custom summer scent, learn about the properties of soy wax and how to use it in your own creations, and leave with a one of a kind, clean burning candle in a luxury glass vessel. Drinks will be served, and all the materials will be provided, so all you need to bring is yourself (and maybe a friend)!",

He characterized Austin's response as \"above and beyond\".  \n  \nI'm proud of our public safety pros. They are heroic. They are ready to help elsewhere. And they are ready to help us here at home. And I support our Fire Chief",

On top of how Kerr County mishandled their own budget for political purposes the citizens of the county voted overwhelmingly for a President and cabinet who said they were going to gut federal emergency resources and made true on that promise. \n\nPerhaps the state should setup a fund to reimburse the city when city resources are deployed for assistance outside of the city. \n\nIn what looney tunes world is AFD getting far more shit for a lack of response when it’s not even their job however FEMA dropped the ball and it’s less an issue.",
