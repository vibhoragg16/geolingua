        "selftext": "I‚Äôve been thinking (and writing) about something that‚Äôs been annoying a lot of us quietly: Lagos real estate makes zero economic sense.\n\nThe prices are ridiculous. The logic? Non-existent. You‚Äôre looking at:\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚Ç¶150 million for a one bedroom in Lekki with no parking space,\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚Ç¶7 million annual rent in Ikoyi, even though half the buildings are empty,\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúLuxury‚Äù flats with paint peeling 6 months after handover,\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd developers still building more.\n\nThe average young couple in Lagos can‚Äôt dream of owning a modest apartment. Most of us are either renting till 50, moving to the mainland, or leaving the country entirely.\n\nSo I decided to break it down. What I found is depressing but predictable.\n\n\nüí∞ Chapter 1: It‚Äôs Not Real Demand\n\nThere‚Äôs this illusion that Lagos Island is booming with high income buyers. But the demand we‚Äôre seeing is artificial. Walk through parts of Lekki Phase 1 and Ikoyi many flats are completely empty. ‚ÄúTo Let‚Äù signs are just part of the scenery now.\n\nAnd yet prices don‚Äôt drop. Why? Because these properties aren‚Äôt meant to be rented or bought by real people. They‚Äôre assets for signaling wealth not for solving housing needs.\n\nüßº Chapter 2: Money Laundering, the Unofficial Urban Planner\n\nOne of the biggest drivers of these absurd prices is money laundering. Real estate is one of the easiest ways to convert dirty cash into clean assets. You overprice a flat, leave it empty, and boom your money now ‚Äúlives‚Äù in Lekki.\n\nDevelopers know this. Many of them don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs rented out. It‚Äôs about converting sketchy wealth into a property you can flaunt on a listing, or flip years later. The value isn‚Äôt in use it‚Äôs in appearance.\n\nüß† Chapter 3: Anchoring Bias & Vibes Pricing\n\nWhy do landlords refuse to lower prices, even if their buildings stay empty for a year?\n\nBecause in Lagos, price equals prestige. If I say rent is ‚Ç¶10 million, it doesn‚Äôt matter if no one pays the property is now ‚Äúworth‚Äù ‚Ç¶10 million. That‚Äôs the anchor.\n\nEven worse, once one developer pegs his 2-bedroom at ‚Ç¶120M, everyone else follows suit, whether it makes sense or not. It‚Äôs a giant status contest masquerading as a housing market.\n\nüèòÔ∏è Chapter 4: The Real Victims = The Middle Class\n\nYoung professionals are getting priced out entirely. There‚Äôs no proper mortgage system. No transparent pricing. No consumer protections. Most people are just hustling for 1-2 year rents with no guarantee they won‚Äôt be kicked out.\n\nWhat we‚Äôve created is a reverse urban utopia: the further you move from the island, the more livable your life becomes except now you‚Äôre spending half of it in traffic.\n\nüîÅ So What Now?\n\nMarkets are supposed to respond to incentives. When things get too expensive, prices fall or new supply comes in. But Lagos Island doesn‚Äôt work like that because the market isn‚Äôt being driven by real people trying to live.\n\nIt‚Äôs driven by:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPeople hiding wealth,\n\t‚Ä¢\tDevelopers building for ego,\n\t‚Ä¢\tBuyers treating property like NFTs,\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd a refusal to blink first in the pricing war.\n\nI wrote a full commentary article about all this going deeper into the psychology, the incentives, and what it would actually take to fix it.\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs the full thing:\nüëâ https://substack.com/@naijascr/note/p-167306498?r=5u6j8h&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=notes-share-action\n\nBut mostly, I‚Äôd love to hear what you think. Are you renting in Lagos? Trying to buy? Do you think the market will ever correct itself, or is this just how it‚Äôll always be?\n\nLet‚Äôs talk.",

I always trusted that here, at least, there was a society of intellectual Nigerians that would never devolve to the level of Twitter or Nairaland. This \"peace\" was sometimes broken by tribalistic, religiously ignorant, or even political arguments and posts. I could live with that.   \nBUT\n\nRecently, there has been a noticeable and annoying rise in purely political propaganda and Public relations posts on this subreddit. This is still two years before the elections, and there is this much political activity. I am afraid that if this is allowed to continue unrestricted, r/Nigeria in 2027 would look like Nairaland in 2014/15. These posts are easy to spot, they don't seem natural, and they are made with the sole purpose of eliciting responses, like the annoying engagement bait on X nowadays. \n\nPLEASE, I beg all of us to leave this place as a boring, quiet, peaceful space for Nigerians to interact online. Let us now turn this place into another political, tribalistic, etc, battleground. We have enough battles on all other platforms, even TikTok. This is the last bastion; let us not allow ourselves to be overrun by these professional Propagandists, engagement farmers and public relations...people!.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.",

And in the first couple of months abroad I already learnt that the Nigeria education system doesn't even teach you how to write your name the correct way, I had a lot of problems with it. A lot of people still don't know what first name and last name is. Also I noticed that the Nigeria education system is just basically cramming knowledge and what the teacher is telling you even if it's right or wrong. There are many people who are not curious for knowledge. So many people only acquire knowledge when someone tells them a new information. There is nothing like  independent learning or independent research. Right from grade 9 I had assignments. Assignment is not homework. Assignment requires you to do a lot of research on your own on a topic. Back then I used to think it was pointless because most people would just copy and paste the research they have done but now in Nigeria I have realize that it was actually a good practice. The amount of things I have had to explain to people who even have a better degree than I do is alarming. Because there is no way you will find a male in his late 20s who has no knowledge about World war II or even Hitler. Imagine me asking someone who is a medical doctor, which country Adolf Hitler is from and they have no idea. I remember when I was taking my common entrance exam for secondary school there was a subject called general knowledge, isn't that subject being taught in schools anymore? I have a friend who studied computer science but doesn't know how to code and when I asked him why he said the university he went to the only thought the theory part of coding there was no practical. As in whenever they are teaching instead of them using computers they are using paper and pen. \n\nThe education system needs modernization. In my opinion this thing of grouping people into science commercial and art students is very stupid. That's how you have medical doctors who have literally no clue how the economy of the country works. \n\nLol it's in Nigeria where I first saw that people like Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe were referred to as the most intelligent people. Like do you know how funny that sounds? Imagine UK regarding J.K Rowling's as one of the most intelligent person in the country? Or US referring to George R. R Martin as one of the most intelligent peeson in the country? Where are our physicians? \n\nThe education system is not going forward. It's just stagnant. ",

I am a student at Columbia University in NYC, currently working on an international study with the University of Cambridge Policy Research Group. The research focuses on attitudes towards social media and digital platform regulation across the globe.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm the only one in my research group representing Nigeria, and despite my best efforts, I‚Äôm struggling to gather enough responses to make sure Nigerian voices are heard. I‚Äôve been doing everything I can‚Äîmessaging all my Instagram, FaceBook and LinkedIn contacts, asking my friends and family in Nigeria to spread the word, even hitting the streets to get people to fill out the survey. I‚Äôve been banned from posting on social media platforms, several Reddit pages, and some Facebook groups. It‚Äôs been really tough, and I‚Äôm at the point where without more responses, I won‚Äôt be able to publish my research, pass my class, or graduate.\n\nThe way I‚Äôve been collecting data often seems like spam to people, so it‚Äôs been hard to get support. But I‚Äôve found that asking my connections directly has been the most effective way to get real responses. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reaching out to the¬†¬†community - your influence could be the key to getting the word out and making sure Nigeria is represented in this global study. It would mean everything if you could spend 5 minutes participating in the research ([CLICK HERE](https://jrp.pscholars.org/who-should-regulate-the-internet/)) and share with a few friends or family members living in Nigeria.\n\nThe survey is anonymous, so privacy is guaranteed, and it‚Äôs a real opportunity for Lagosians to have their say in a study that could influence future laws about social media and the internet. Thank you so much for considering this. I truly appreciate any help you can offer, including any advice on how I can get some more responses.",

Just for the receptionist to tell me I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot being grateful‚Äù as if I wasn‚Äôt patient for hours while he ignored and didn‚Äôt try and solve the problem, as if he didn‚Äôt waste my time to print two pieces of paper. Then later they‚Äôll tell you to recommend their hospital to someone else, while receptionists carry baseless audacity and useless pride to talk to a paying customer, who has brought over 5 patients to their establishment ",

      "text": "Governor Umar Namadi has reiterated his administration‚Äôs commitment to environmental sustainability as Jigawa State prepares to host the 2025 Green World Day event.\n\nThe event, marking the 10th anniversary of the National Agency for the Great Green Wall (NAGGW), is slated for 29 July, 2025, in Dutse and will be the first time the summit is hosted outside the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nSpeaking while receiving the Director-General of NAGGW, Saleh Abubakar, and his team at the Government House, Dutse, Mr Namadi hailed the decision to bring the celebration to Jigawa State.\n\n‚ÄúYou are coming to Jigawa today, and the objective for which you came‚ÄîI think it is an honour that we will continue to cherish,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe governor emphasised the long-standing relationship between his administration and the agency, noting that Jigawa is not a new partner but an active and dependable ally.\n\n‚ÄúI can remember that I was one of the first governors that paid a visit to the agency when I assumed office. So, I began to build a very strong relationship with the agency. I also visited again. I think I visited the agency about two times. This shows that we, as a government and people of Jigawa State, recognises the importance of this agency.\n\nArticle Page with Financial Support Promotion Nigerians need credible journalism.

So, for the strategic importance of the state, aside from the normal operation of the Great Green Wall activities, projects like the Action Against Desertification were all executed in Jigawa State.\n\n‚ÄúThe agency will be bold to state that Jigawa State has the highest number of Great Green Wall activities and other international funding support. Hence, the reason to select Jigawa State as the venue for this year‚Äôs Great Green Wall Day, which coincides with the 10th anniversary of the agency,‚Äù Mr Abubakar stated.\n\nHe also announced that the summit will feature six major activities: a National Green Summit, fund-raising campaigns, tree-planting drives, environmental education, cultural engagement, and awards for partners and contributors.\n\nMr Abubakar also revealed that Nigeria planned to plant 20 billion trees between this year and 2030, citing Ethiopia‚Äôs 7.5 billion tree milestone as inspiration.\n\n‚ÄúSo, within these five years, Your Excellency, we want to plant 20 billion trees in this country.‚Äù\n\nResponding, Governor Namadi reassured the agency of Jigawa‚Äôs full partnership and hospitality.\n\n‚ÄúI want to assure you that Jigawa State is happy to host this year‚Äôs summit, and we are ready to ensure its success in Dutse.

      "text": "The Kogi Central Senator, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, has notified the management of the National Assembly of her intention to resume legislative duties on Tuesday.\n\nThis followed the judgement of the Federal High Court declaring her suspension by the Senate unconstitutional.\n\nMrs Akpoti-Uduaghan made the notification in a letter dated 11 July and addressed to the Clerk of the National Assembly. The letter was written by her legal counsel, Michael Numa (SAN), urging the legislature to take immediate steps to facilitate her return in compliance with the judgment of court presided by Binta Nyako.\n\nIn the letter, the senator referenced the court decision which ruled that her six-month suspension was excessive, unconstitutional, and a violation of her constituents‚Äô right to representation.\n\n‚ÄúAfter a thorough consideration of the facts and applicable law, the Honourable Court made several findings and orders. including, notably, a definitive pronouncement in Order 10 that the six-month suspension imposed on the Plaintiff was excessive, overreaching, and inconsistent with her ability to comply with the provisions of Section 63 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n‚ÄúThis finding aligns with long-standing judicial precedent as well as the provisions of Order 66(4) of the Senate Standing Orders. 2023 which does not contemplates a suspension exceeding a period of 14days.\n\nArticle Page with Financial Support Promotion Nigerians need credible journalism.

SUPPORT NOW x Do this later\n\n‚ÄúIn consequence, Her Lordship directed that the Senate has the power and indeed should exercise that power to recall Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan and allow her to resume representation of the constituents who duly elected her to the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This order constitutes a binding decision within the meaning of Section 318 of the Constitution,‚Äù the letter said.\n\nThe senator expressed her readiness to return to the Senate on Tuesday, 15 July, and called on the National Assembly to treat the notice with urgency to avoid further infringement on her constitutional rights or contempt for the court‚Äôs authority.\n\n‚ÄúAccordingly, we respectfully demand that you give immediate effect to the clear and binding Order of the Federal High Court by taking all necessary steps to facilitate Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan‚Äôs resumption of her legislative duties forthwith, in full compliance with the Court‚Äôs judgment.\n\n‚ÄúPlease, also take notice that Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan intends to resume her legislative duties on Tuesday, the 15th day of July, 2025.\n\n‚ÄúWe trust that this matter will be treated with the urgency and seriousness it demands, in order to avoid any further breach of the Plaintiff‚Äôs constitutional rights or disregard for the authority of the Court.‚Äù\n\nAppeal against contempt fine\n\nMrs Akpoti-Uduaghan‚Äôs notice to resume comes two days after she filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal challenging the N5 million fine imposed on her by the same court.\n\nThe fine was imposed as part of a contempt ruling issued by Mrs Nyako, who found the senator guilty of civil contempt over a satirical Facebook post made while her case against the Senate was still ongoing.\n\nIn a notice of appeal dated 9 July and filed by her lead counsel, Roland Otaru (SAN), Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan is asking the appellate court to set aside the contempt conviction. She argues that the ruling was flawed both in fact and in law, and constituted a violation of her right to freedom of expression.\n\nThe senator is seeking a reversal of the ruling on the basis that it was not only erroneous but also undermines judicial fairness and her right to criticise public institutions within legal bounds.\n\nBackstory\n\nMrs Akpoti-Uduaghan was suspended in March 2025 for alleged misconduct during the Senate plenary session of 20 February. The suspension was unanimously approved by her colleagues based on the Ethics Committee‚Äôs recommendation.\n\nHer suspension was controversial with some accusing the Senate of abuse of power even after she reported the matter to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the global body of parliamentarians.\n\nShe subsequently approached the court to challenge the suspension, which led to the ruling delivered by Mrs Nyako.\n\nThe court held that suspending an elected senator for six months was not only disproportionate but also effectively silenced an entire senatorial district for most of the legislative year.\n\nIt is unclear if the National Assembly will grant the senator‚Äôs request.\n\nOnly on Thursday, the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, announced the removal of Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan as chairperson of the diaspora committee of the upper chamber.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n",

      "text": "Sometimes the highest act of responsibility is to seek greener pastures, not out of selfishness, but out of a refusal to endorse mediocrity by your continued presence in it. The question then is not whether to stay or go, but whether staying still serves a purpose. And if it does not, then you must ask yourself, what exactly are you remaining for? There is dignity in labour, but there is no dignity in wilful stagnation, and we should be wise enough to know the difference.\n\nI recently watched the viral interview with a professor from Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), in which he painted a sombre picture of what it means to be an academic in Nigeria‚Äôs public university system today. It was raw and honest, and I respect that. But I must say, I found parts of his argument deeply troubling, not because his complaints were baseless, but because his conclusion was too forgiving of a broken system. He cited cultural and religious considerations, including the need to observe Friday prayers, as reasons he would not take up an academic position in a country like South Korea. If one is suffering in his own country, invoking culture and religion as reasons to remain in that suffering should not go unchallenged. If the reality at home is one of degradation, if the system you serve is not structured to reward merit or dignity, then choosing to stay is no longer a noble act, as it becomes complicity. The very system our professor laments is also the one he defends by refusing to explore better alternatives. There is no honour in remaining within a failing structure out of fear of adjustment elsewhere.\n\nNigeria‚Äôs public university system was not built to survive the realities of the 21st century. It is operating on fumes, driven by sentiment rather than sustainability. There is no coherent model underpinning it today, as there is no meaningful competition, no deliberate investment in excellence, no infrastructure to support world-class research or teaching. And the result is a cycle of strikes, underpayment and mass disillusionment. But what concerns me more than the system‚Äôs failure is the resignation with which many accept it. If you are educated and equipped with marketable skills, it is not a virtue to stay where you are consistently disrespected and undervalued. It is not a badge of honour to endure perpetual frustration in the name of loyalty to a place that offers you no dignity in return. We must learn to differentiate between perseverance and stagnation.\n\nThere are moments when the only dignified protest is departure. And yes, I do mean literal departure. In a country where those who hold power over your income do not see you as a priority, where negotiations begin and end with the assumption that you have no better option, the only way to command respect is to create absence. Complaints do not shake a government, but consequences do. If the government sees no visible loss in academics leaving, why would it take them seriously? The strikes are not working. Every time ASUU down tools, the government simply waits them out. It has learnt, over time, that after months of protest, the same lecturers who initiated the strike will quietly return, often weakened by financial strain. Worse still, some beg for work to resume, not because their demands have been met, but because their situation has become desperate. This sends a dangerous message, that no matter how long the strike lasts, the lecturers will come back eventually and nothing significant will change.\n\nIt is a retrospective fallacy that suggests that because your lecturers remained in the system long enough to teach you, which presumably led to a positive outcome, their continued presence must always be right or justified. This ignores the fact that we are no longer talking about the past, but we are confronting a present-day reality that these same lecturers have acknowledged as harmful and unsustainable.\n\nBut imagine, for a moment, a different kind of consequence. Imagine if the very people leading these strikes, such as departmental heads, union leaders and senior lecturers, suddenly began to exit en masse, not with noise but with quiet resolve. Imagine if top academics began to accept positions in global institutions, because they could no longer justify being part of a theatre of perpetual failure. Such exits would send a powerful message to both government and society that the system has failed, and we are no longer lending it our credibility.\n\nAnd I find it intellectually lazy when people argue that you should not advise your former lecturers to consider alternative paths, even when they themselves have expressed dissatisfaction with their current situation, simply because they once taught you. This line of reasoning shifts the discussion away from exploring meaningful solutions, whether good or bad, and instead reduces it to a personal matter. Beyond its intellectual weakness, the argument rests on a clear philosophical fallacy, one that ought to be recognised before anyone enters a serious discussion. It is a retrospective fallacy that suggests that because your lecturers remained in the system long enough to teach you, which presumably led to a positive outcome, their continued presence must always be right or justified. This ignores the fact that we are no longer talking about the past, but we are confronting a present-day reality that these same lecturers have acknowledged as harmful and unsustainable.\n\nArticle Page with Financial Support Promotion Nigerians need credible journalism.

SUPPORT NOW x Do this later\n\nThe flaw in the argument also extends to a false cause fallacy, that implies that one‚Äôs success is solely due to the lecturers who stayed in the system, as if no alternative paths or educators could have provided a comparable or even better outcome all over the world. It presumes a single, linear cause-effect relationship, without any evidence that the presence of those particular lecturers was either the only or necessary condition for success. The reasoning also contains a moralistic fallacy, which is the assumption that because something ought to be the case (that lecturers should stay and educate ideally), then it must always remain so, regardless of changing conditions or harsh realities. Such a position is detached from the complex and often difficult choices people must make in the face of a broken or unrewarding system.\n\nThe gap between merit and outcome is vast and cruel. Professor Farooq Kperogi also once noted that many Nigerian elites cannot intimidate him despite their wealth because he is living a life they themselves can only dream of. Thus, it is not about riches but about freedom, and too many in Nigeria are trapped not only by poverty, but also by the persistent illusion that they must stay and endure no matter the cost.\n\nProfessor Moses Ochonu once remarked that beyond the obvious economic advantages of moving abroad, there are also intangible benefits that are rarely discussed. In societies that function, a decent home, quality education for your children, a reliable healthcare system, occasional family holidays and peace of mind are attainable for those who work hard. But in Nigeria, these things are luxuries that depend as much on fortune as on effort. Even the most disciplined professionals often need a touch of luck to achieve a modestly fulfilling life.\n\nThe gap between merit and outcome is vast and cruel. Professor Farooq Kperogi also once noted that many Nigerian elites cannot intimidate him despite their wealth because he is living a life they themselves can only dream of. Thus, it is not about riches but about freedom, and too many in Nigeria are trapped not only by poverty, but also by the persistent illusion that they must stay and endure no matter the cost.\n\nMy own belief is that we must be equipped for eventualities. In life, we should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. And part of that preparation means cultivating the skills and exposure needed to move if things do not improve. No scripture, constitution or cultural edict says you must suffer endlessly in the place where you were born. Sometimes the highest act of responsibility is to seek greener pastures, not out of selfishness, but out of a refusal to endorse mediocrity by your continued presence in it. The question then is not whether to stay or go, but whether staying still serves a purpose. And if it does not, then you must ask yourself, what exactly are you remaining for?

Instead, the application merely restated legal arguments already raised and decided in the earlier proceedings.\n\nBut the Nigerian government argued that the ECOWAS Court lacked jurisdiction to hear Mr Todd‚Äôs application as a foreign national.\n\nThe Nigerian government also said the court improperly exercised appellate jurisdiction over decisions of Nigerian courts and Mr Todd‚Äôs complaint was inadmissible, having been previously resolved by the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nRuling\n\nThe court rejected all three points, ruling that the issues had been addressed in the original case and did not amount to new facts capable of triggering a revision.\n\nThe court held that the request was legally baseless, inadmissible under the court‚Äôs protocol, and an abuse of its post-judgment procedure.\n\nThe court dismissed the application and ordered the Nigerian government to comply fully with the November 2023 ruling, including the payment of the $10,000 compensation to Mr Todd.\n\nThe court asked the Nigerian government to bear the costs incurred by Mr Todd in responding to the revision application.\n\nBackground\n\nMr Todd arrived in Nigeria in December 2017 to implement development projects aimed at employment generation, particularly in Akwa Ibom State, South-south Nigeria.\n\nHe claimed his business, Serge, had investment pipelines from Australia, Europe, the UAE, and China, with a planned start date of early 2018.\n\nHowever, on 23 July 2019, EFCC operatives seized his Australian passport (No. N1819485), stalling his movement and disrupting his activities.\n\nDespite numerous appeals and petitions‚Äîincluding to then-President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly‚ÄîMr Todd‚Äôs passport was never returned and eventually expired.\n\nMr Todd alleged that he faced harassment, extortion attempts, and targeted efforts by certain individuals to hijack his projects.\n\nHe further claimed the EFCC failed to grant him a fair hearing, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when foreign nationals were allowed to return home.\n\nThe prolonged detention of his passport, he said, left him stranded in Nigeria for over two years, separated from his family, and unable to travel‚Äîamounting to a gross violation of his fundamental rights.\n\nThe Arewa Public and Security Analysts Forum reportedly wrote to the EFCC‚Äôs acting chairman at the time, Mohammed Umar, appealing for intervention.\n\nMr Todd‚Äôs case adds to mounting criticism over the operations of Nigeria‚Äôs anti-graft agencies, particularly the EFCC, which has faced allegations of abuse of power, prolonged investigations, and selective enforcement under the leadership of its suspended chairman, Ibrahim Magu.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n",

      "text": "The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has unveiled its plan to tackle voter apathy during Saturday‚Äôs local government elections in the state.\n\nAt a press conference in Lagos on Thursday, LASIEC chairperson, Bola Okikiolu-Ighile, said the commission was scaling up voter education and grassroots engagement to increase participation, particularly among historically underrepresented groups.\n\n‚ÄúWe know that apathy is real, especially at the local level,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we went beyond the usual radio and TV announcements. We were on the streets, in the markets, at UNILAG, Badagry, Alimosho ‚Äî we were everywhere.‚Äù\n\nMrs Okikiolu-Ighile, who is a retired judge, said LASIEC deployed voter sensitisation teams across the state‚Äôs five administrative divisions ‚Äî Ikeja, Badagry, Ikorodu, Lagos Island, and Epe ‚Äî with particular focus on young people, women, traders, and persons with disabilities (PWDs).\n\n‚ÄúWe made sure the markets were involved ‚Äî all the women and men. We engaged people with disabilities because we believe everyone is special, especially them. We also met with youth groups and religious organisations to get the message out.‚Äù\n\n13,325 polling units, over 6.2 million PVCs collected\n\nShe disclosed that the number of polling units in Lagos has increased from 8,000 in 2021 to 13,325 this year, in a bid to bring voting points closer to residents and reduce logistical obstacles.\n\nArticle Page with Financial Support Promotion Nigerians need credible journalism.

SUPPORT NOW x Do this later\n\nAccording to LASIEC data, 7,060,195 voters are registered in Lagos, with 6,214,970 Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) collected so far. Around 845,000 PVCs remain uncollected.\n\n‚ÄúWe urge everyone to check their polling units. Because of the expansion, some locations may have changed ‚Äî and this time, it will likely be closer to your home than before.‚Äù\n\nSecurity, logistics\n\nThe LASIEC chair assured the public of adequate security arrangements for the exercise, stating that the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the State Security Service (SSS), and other agencies have committed to deploying at least four officers to each polling unit.\n\n‚ÄúSecurity of lives and properties, as well as the safety of materials before, during, and after the election, is our priority. We‚Äôve been assured that there will be no room for intimidation or violence.‚Äù\n\nShe explained that voting will commence at 8:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m., with provisions made to prioritise persons with disabilities, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and elderly voters.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve trained our staff and informed our polling agents to act accordingly,‚Äù she added.\n\nElection not for sale\n\nMrs Okikiolu-Ighile also emphasised the Commission‚Äôs neutrality and warned against vote-buying, urging residents to see the local government poll as the most immediate and impactful form of democratic participation.\n\n‚ÄúYour vote is your power. Why would you sell it? Why would you remain silent? Silence may be golden sometimes, but not when your community‚Äôs future is at stake.\n\n‚ÄúYou are part of this community. You have a right to choose who leads it. Go out and vote. Don‚Äôt trade that right. Don‚Äôt sit back and complain later,‚Äù she stated.\n\nBackground\n\nIn August 2021, Tayo Ogunbiyi, a director of public affairs at the Ministry of Information and Strategy stated that voter apathy has long plagued local elections in Lagos State.\n\nMr Ogunbiyi noted that voter turnout was reported to be below 18 per cent, while the 2017 edition saw only a marginal difference, with just 17 per cent of registered voters participating.\n\nHe warned that low voter turnout allows candidates to win with a minority of votes, which can undermine legitimacy and reduce public accountability.\n\nFigures from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) show that only about 35 per cent of the 70 million Nigerians registered for the 2011 general elections actually voted.\n\nSimilarly, LASIEC estimates that over 1.4 million PVCs remained uncollected ahead of the 2015 general elections in Lagos.\n\nReport mentioned multiple reasons for the trend: a perception that votes don‚Äôt count, distrust in politicians, concerns about electoral violence, and the belief that local government structures are ineffective.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported that only 41 per cent of Nigerians trust State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) to conduct free and fair local government election.\n\nThe report by the Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre) titled ‚ÄúFrom Apathy to Action: A Reform Blueprint for SIECs and Community-Level Democracy‚Äù, is the latest edition (Volume 5, Issue 2) of HEDA‚Äôs Leadership Approval Rating (LAR) series and was officially launched on Wednesday in Lagos.\n\nThe survey, conducted in June 2025, sampled 1,428 Nigerians across all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nIt found that while 87 per cent of respondents correctly identified SIECs as the statutory agencies responsible for local elections, only 45 per cent believed they operate independently of state governors.\n\n‚ÄúThis reveals a critical trust deficit,‚Äù said Sulaimon Arigbabu, HEDA‚Äôs Executive Secretary, during the launch. ‚ÄúWhere independence and transparency are in doubt, legitimacy quickly collapses.‚Äù\n\nWhile explaining the report, Mr Arigbabu lamented that despite high awareness, voter participation remains abysmally low.\n\nHe said 69 per cent of respondents admitted they had never voted in any local government election.\n\nHe noted that ratings of SIEC performance were similarly dismal‚Äîonly 44 per cent rated their commissions as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or ‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù while 24 per cent graded them ‚ÄúPoor‚Äù or ‚ÄúVery Poor.‚Äù\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n",

SUPPORT NOW x Do this later\n\nBackground\n\nOn 6 September 2024, Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals FZE instituted the suit over the issuance of petroleum product import licences to some companies.\n\nThe plaintiff asked the court to declare that the licences issued by the regulatory agency to the other defendants violated Sections 317(8) and (9) of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021, which permit such imports only in the event of a shortfall. It also sought N100 billion in damages against the authority for allegedly undermining local refining capacity.\n\nIn its counter-affidavit sworn to by Idris Musa, a Senior Regulatory Officer, NMDPRA, argued that Dangote Refinery was not entitled to the prayers sought. Mr Musa said that the refinery‚Äôs production does not yet meet the national daily consumption requirement.\n\nHe added that, in line with Section 317(9) of the Petroleum Industry Act, NMDPRA issued import licences to companies with a track record of international products trading to bridge the supply gap.\n\nMr Musa said the agency is mandated to promote competition and prevent monopolies in the sector, denying allegations of conspiracy against the plaintiff.\n\nNMDPRA further clarified that it issued oil licences to NNPC Limited and oil marketers to address petroleum product shortfalls in the country.\n\nIn November, AYM Shafa Ltd (3rd defendant), A.A. Rano Ltd (4th defendant), and Matrix Petroleum Services Ltd (7th defendant) filed a joint counter-affidavit opposing the suit, warning that granting the plaintiff‚Äôs request would create a monopoly in the downstream oil sector\n\nSimilarly, in December, the regulatory agency NMDPRA, filed its counter-affidavit, maintaining that the refinery‚Äôs production at the time did not meet national sufficiency and that the licences were issued in accordance with the law to bridge supply gaps.\n\nOn 9 December , the plaintiff sought a motion to amend its originating process to correct the name of the second defendant from ‚ÄúNigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited‚Äù to ‚ÄúNigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.‚Äù\n\nIn response, the second defendant, NNPC Limited raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the suit was incompetent and should be struck out for misidentification, among other grounds. The objection was supported by an affidavit deposed to by Isiaka Popoola, a litigation clerk in the law firm representing the company.\n\nOn 18 March, the then-judge, Mr Ekwo, dismissed the objection, ruling that the error in name did not render the suit defective. The court also held that the defendants ought to have responded to the substantive claims before raising procedural objections.\n\nOn 19 March, the judge granted the plaintiff‚Äôs motion to amend its originating summons and directed parties to proceed on the merits of the case.\n\nAdjournment\n\nAt the resumed session, Mr. Ibrahim informed the court that the matter was slated for mention. He explained that Justice Ekwo had earlier granted an order for amendment, which had already been effected.\n\nHe added while some defendants had regularised their processes, others, including NMDPRA, were yet to do so.\n\nHe reminded the court that while the matter was before Mr Ekwo, NNPC filed a notice of preliminary objection which was refused.\n\nHowever, the company filed a fresh preliminary objection in June, and Dangote Refinery responded. He therefore requested an adjournment to enable all parties to regularise their filings.\n\nFCCPC seeks to join the suit\n\nBasima Terhemba, who appeared for the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), a party seeking to join the suit, informed the court that the commission had appealed a ruling that dismissed its joinder application.\n\nHe noted that the appeal had been filed and that the case concerned FCCPC‚Äôs core mandate. He argued that a ruling without the commission‚Äôs participation could be prejudicial.\n\nIn response, Mr Ibrahim said the former judge had ruled that FCCPC was not a relevant party, describing it as a ‚Äúmeddlesome interloper.‚Äù He urged the court to proceed without the commission, whose appeal, he claimed lacked substance.\n\nMr Umar agreed that the appeal should not hinder the main case from progressing and adjourned the matter until 29 September. He also ordered that hearing notices be served on the defendants.\n\nDangote Refinery\n\nThe Dangote Refinery, a massive project designed to process 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day, began operation in 2023, with the aim of ending Nigeria‚Äôs reliance on imported refined petroleum products and boosting the nation‚Äôs energy security.\n\nHowever, the refinery faced controversy related to crude oil supply shortages, pricing disputes, and concerns about its impact on domestic fuel prices and the overall economy.\n\nLast year, NNPC ended its exclusive purchase agreement with Dangote Refinery, opening up the market for other marketers to buy petrol directly from the refinery.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n",

The judge said the post was disrespectful and prejudicial to the pending case.\n\nBackground of the ruling\n\nIn her judgment, Mrs Nyako held that Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan‚Äôs satirical post is a contempt of court though the offence was considered civil in nature and not criminal. As a result, the judge imposed a fine of N5 million, ordering the senator to publish an apology in two national newspapers and on her Facebook page within seven days.\n\nHowever, the court declined to sentence her to imprisonment on the ground that the alleged contempt did not warrant a custodial sentence.\n\nMrs Nyako also issued a judgment in the senator‚Äôs favour, saying that suspending an elected lawmaker for six months effectively denies a constituency its right to representation for an entire legislative year.\n\nArticle Page with Financial Support Promotion Nigerians need credible journalism.

She alleged that the judge failed to comply with provisions of the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act.\n\nIn the third ground of appeal, the appellant maintains that the Facebook post had no relevance to the actual subject of the court proceedings, as it addressed issues of sexual harassment, whereas the case before the court was solely focused on challenging her suspension.\n\nMrs Akpoti-Uduaghan also faults the judge‚Äôs order directing her to tender a public apology and pay a fine, describing it as excessive and legally unfounded.\n\nThe senator insists that a fine imposed in contempt proceedings constitutes a criminal sanction, which should not arise in civil proceedings. She argues that the trial judge had no power to impose a penalty payable to the federal government without following proper criminal procedure.\n\nIn the last ground of appeal, she describes the N5 million fine as excessive and punitive to the alleged offence.\n\nPrayers before the Court of Appeal\n\nIn the notice, Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan is asking the Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment delivered by Mrs Nyako and declare that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to try contempt ex facie curiae (outside the court‚Äôs presence) involving the imposition of a criminal fine.\n\nShe also seeks the appeal court‚Äôs order to affirm that such sanctions require criminal procedures, including proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a declaration that the lower court acted without proper legal authority by imposing the fine in a civil matter.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n",

SUPPORT NOW x Do this later\n\nThe committee is expected to work closely with the Lagos State Government, the African Union, and the AFRIMA International Committee to deliver an event that matches the grandeur of its theme.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of the federal LOC at her ministry‚Äôs conference room in Abuja on Wednesday, the Minister of Arts, Culture, Tourism and Creative Economy, Barrister Hannatu Musawa, assured the stakeholders of the government‚Äôs readiness to collaborate with Lagos and the AFRIMA team fully.\n\nMrs Musawa said: ‚ÄúThe ministry is fully ready to work hand-in-hand with the Lagos State Government and the International Committee of AFRIMA to host what she described as the best AFRIMA yet.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the minister, the initiative aligns perfectly with President Tinubu‚Äôs vision of harnessing the creative industry for national development. She said, ‚ÄúThis is more than just an awards show.\n\n‚ÄúIt is a major platform to create jobs, promote tourism, celebrate African talents, and tell our positive stories authentically through music to the world. We are excited to work with the Lagos State government, the AFRIMA team, and the African Union to deliver a world-class event,‚Äù The minister explained.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Ugochi Akudo-Nwosu, Director of Entertainment and Creative Economy at the Federal Ministry of Arts, Culture and Creative Economy in Nigeria, conveyed the President‚Äôs official approval and expressed gratitude for his support.\n\nReeling out her appreciation to Mr Tinubu and the ministers involved, Mrs Akudo-Nwosu said: ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Honorable Minister and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry and our agencies, we appreciate the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu (GCFR) for granting us the opportunity, Nigeria opportunity, to host this historic event during this administration.\n\n‚ÄúWe also thank the Honourable Minister for providing a platform for us to collaborate with AFRIMA for this event to come true in November this year, and the Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs as well as the Honourable Minister, co-chairing with our Honourable Minister, to make this dream come to pass,‚Äù she said.\n\nThe newly constituted LOC comprises representatives from key ministries, including Arts, Culture, Tourism and Creative Economy; Information and National Orientation; Foreign Affairs; Interior; Youth; Education; and Aviation. Agencies such as the Nigerian Film Corporation, National Film and Video Censors Board, and the National Council for Arts and Culture are also represented. Delegates from the African Union and the AFRIMA International Committee are part of the organising body.\n\nAFRIMA in Lagos\n\nAFRIMA president and executive producer Mike Dada also lauded the Federal Government‚Äôs rapid action and full commitment to the awards, stating that it is a powerful force for unity promotion in Africa.\n\nMr Dada said, ‚ÄúThis is not just an event approval. It‚Äôs a loud statement that the Nigerian government values the culture and creative industry, CCI, and its power to promote unity and prosperity across Africa. He appreciated the Lagos State Government for agreeing to serve as the official host city and for its consistent support of industry.\n\nExpressing the importance of the host city, Lagos, in the African entertainment industry, the AFRIMA president stated, ‚ÄúNigeria has always been a creative and cultural powerhouse. With this support, we are confident that this year‚Äôs AFRIMA will be an unforgettable celebration of African talent and creativity for the world.\n\n‚ÄúIt is fantastic that the Federal Government has come on board, and we are happy that the Minister has mentioned that all of us are going to work together with the Host City, Lagos state, to deliver the best AFRIMA in history,‚Äù he stated.\n\nThe AFRIMA award event will air live on 109 stations in 84 countries. Supported by the African Union since 2014, AFRIMA is a global celebration of African music rooted in seven key pillars: the awards ceremony, music festivals, the AFRIMA Kreative Academy, the Business Music Hub, talent discovery and promotion, policy debate and advisory, and advocacy.\n\nThis year‚Äôs AFRIMA event will feature Diamond Showcase, an exciting week-long programme from 25 to 27 November, featuring star-studded and world-class activities.\n\nAlso, Welcome Soiree will be held on 26 November, followed by the Africa Music Business Summit on 27 and 28 November, 2025.\n\nFurthermore, on 28 November, AFRIMA Music Village will light up with live performances in Lagos, while nominees and industry professionals will gather for the Industry Party on 29 November. Moreover, the grand finale will feature an award ceremony scheduled for 30 November 2025.\n\nAFRIMA\n\nThe music events are expected to be modelled after AFRIMA‚Äôs framework, which rests on seven foundational pillars: Music Awards, which are annual honours for the continent‚Äôs best talents; Music Festivals, platforms that celebrate Africa‚Äôs musical diversity; and Music Business Hub, which provides industry-focused support, including legal and financial tools.\n\nAs part of the framework are The AFRIMA Kreative Academy, TAKA; Training programs for emerging creatives, Talent Discovery and Promotion; opportunities for new voices to shine, Foundation, CSR and CSA; social responsibility programs uplifting artists and communities and Advisory and Policy Debates; advocacy for artist rights and cultural policy reforms.\n\nAFRIMA has remained guided by its core values, which are represented by the acronym FACE-IT: Fairness, Authenticity, Creativity, Excellence, Integrity, and Transparency.\n\nSince its first edition in Nigeria in 2014, AFRIMA has travelled internationally, touching down in Ghana in 2018 and Senegal in 2023. More so, Nigeria previously hosted the awards in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2021.\n\nThis highlights Africa‚Äôs creative diversity and unites the diaspora through rhythm and culture. Even in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic halted the live event, AFRIMA responded with the virtual ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù concert, supporting the AU‚Äôs COVID-19 Response Fund.\n\nAs it prepares to host thousands of creatives, fans, and industry professionals in Lagos again, AFRIMA 2025 promises to be more than a show; it will celebrate resilience, talent, and Africa‚Äôs unstoppable spirit.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n",

As Allah Almighty said in the Qur‚Äôan:\n\n‚ÄúCertainly did Allah confer [great] favour upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book [i.e., the Qur‚Äôan] and wisdom, although they had been before in manifest error.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan, 3:164]\n\nAnd blessings and peace be upon the most noble and purest of creation, our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), a role model and leader of the righteous, seal of the Prophets and Messengers and a mercy for all the worlds.

SUPPORT NOW x Do this later\n\n‚ÄúAllah chooses Messengers from among the angels and from among the people.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan, 22:75]\n\nSo, He sent him:\n\n‚ÄúAs a witness, a bringer of good tidings, a Warner, one who invites to Allah, by His permission, and an illuminating lamp.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan, 33:45-46]\n\nAnd Allah, (the Exalted), has decreed honour, contentment and distinction for those who follow his path and decreed humiliation, misery and degradation for those who go against his order. So may the blessings and peace of our Lord be upon him as often as the righteous mention him and as long as night follows day.\n\nDear brothers and sisters! The enemies of Islam never tire of repeating the claim that Islam is unjust to women, oppresses them, deprives them of their rights and considers them no more than servants and a means of enjoyment for men. But this is a falsehood refuted by what has been authentically narrated about the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) regarding the honour he accorded women and his concern for their condition. He (Peace be upon him) used to consult women, deal with them gently, support them in all situations and give them their complete rights in a way never dreamt of before.\n\nBefore Islam, the Arabs disliked having daughters and considered them a source of shame. Some of them were even known to have buried their female children alive. The noble Qur‚Äôan describes it as follows:\n\n‚ÄúAnd when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief. He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan, 16:58-59]\n\nAnd in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance when a woman‚Äôs husband died, his sons and relatives inherited her as property; if they wished they would marry her to one of them and if they wished they could prevent her from remarrying and keep her thus until death. Islam did away with all that through its just rulings which guarantee the rights of women as well as those of men. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) declared that women are equal to men in all aspects of humanity, saying:\n\n‚ÄúWomen are but sisters of men.‚Äù [Ahmad, Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi]\n\nSo in Islam there is no conflict between the two sexes as its opponents imagine; rather, a brotherly relationship of mutual cooperation exists between them.\n\nThe noble Qur‚Äôan has confirmed the equality of men and women in the realms of faith, action and compensation in the Hereafter, for as Allah Almighty stated:\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so ‚Äì for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan, 33:35]\n\nAnd He the Most High said:\n\n‚ÄúWhoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer ‚Äì those will enter Paradise, being given provision therein without account.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan, 40:40]\n\nAllah‚Äôs Messenger (Peace be upon him) mentioned his love for women, saying:\n\n‚ÄúBeloved to me from your world are women and pleasant scent, and my greatest pleasure is in prayer (Salah).‚Äù [Ahmad and an-Nasa‚Äôi ‚Äì graded as sahih by al-Albani]\n\nSo if the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) loved women, how could he belittle or oppress them?\n\nAnd while the Prophet (Peace be upon him) abolished the customary hatred of daughters and the terrible practice of burying them alive, he encouraged raising them well and treating them kindly. He (Peace be upon him) said:\n\n‚ÄúWhoever cares for two girls until they reach puberty will come with me thus on the Day of Resurrection,‚Äù and he brought together his two fingers.‚Äù [Muslim]\n\nThis shows that one attains high position and nearness to the Prophet (Peace be upon him) owing to his care and protection of his daughters until they reach the age of puberty and responsibility.\n\nHe (Peace be upon him) also said:\n\n‚ÄúWhoever has three daughters or three sisters or two daughters or two sisters and lives with them in kindness, fearing Allah in regard to them, will enter Paradise.‚Äù [At-Tirmidhi ‚Äì graded as sahih by alAlbani]\n\nAnd the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was concerned with educating women. He even appointed a day for them to assemble and would come to teach them from that which Allah had taught him. [Muslim]\n\nHe (Peace be upon him) did not make woman a prisoner within the house, as they claim, but allowed her to go out to take care of her needs, visit her relatives and visit the sick. He (Peace be upon him) allowed her to buy and sell in the marketplace as long as she adhered to modest conduct and proper dress. He (Peace be upon him) also allowed her to attend the Mosque and forbade preventing her, saying:\n\n‚ÄúDo not prevent your women from [coming to] the Mosques.‚Äù [Ahmad and Abu Dawud]\n\nAnd he (Peace be upon him) urged kindness toward her with the words:\n\n‚ÄúBe advised to be good to women.‚Äù [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]\n\nThis involves good treatment, respect for her rights, concern for her feelings and avoidance of any kind of harm.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) encouraged husbands to spend on their wives. He (Peace be upon him) said:\n\n‚ÄúYou will not spend any expenditure seeking the approval of Allah but that you will be rewarded for it ‚Äì even the bite of food you put into the mouth of your wife.‚Äù [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]\n\nAnd he (Peace be upon him) said that what is spent on the family is the best expenditure, saying:\n\n‚ÄúThe best dinar is the one a man spends on his dependants.‚Äù [Muslim]\n\nHe (Peace be upon him) also said:\n\n‚ÄúWhen a man gives his wife a drink of water he is rewarded.‚Äù [Ahmad ‚Äì graded by al-Albani as hasan]\n\nWhen Irbadh Ibn Sariyah heard this Hadith he hastened to bring some water to his wife to drink, telling her what he had heard from the Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him).\n\nRespected brothers and sisters! This is how the Prophet Muhammad taught his companions good treatment of women, affection and sympathy towards them, providing them with all kinds of benefit and spending on them appropriately. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) made clear that good treatment of women is a sign of the nobility of a man‚Äôs soul and generosity of his nature. He (Peace be upon him) stated:\n\n‚ÄúThe best of you is the best of you to your wives.‚Äù [Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi]\n\nAnd he (Peace be upon him) forbade hatred of one‚Äôs wife, saying:\n\n‚ÄúLet not a male believer hate a female believer; if he dislikes one trait of hers he will be pleased with another one.‚Äù [Muslim]\n\nThus, the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) ordered men to look for the positive aspects and praiseworthy actions in women and overlook the errors and negative aspects, because looking for bad behaviour and dwelling upon it leads to aversion and dislike between the spouses.\n\nHe (Peace be upon him) prohibited beating women, saying:\n\n‚ÄúDo not strike the female servants of Allah.‚Äù [Abu Dawud]\n\nAnd he (Peace be upon him) threatened those who harm them with the words:\n\n‚ÄúO Allah, indeed, I make binding the right of the two vulnerable ones: the orphan and the woman.‚Äù [Ahmad and Ibn Majah]\n\nIt meant that he would not make lawful the harming of either of them, and whoever does so has exposed himself to difficulty and punishment in this world and the next.\n\nHe (Peace be upon him) also prohibited husbands from exposing the secrets (private aspects) of their wives, as he prohibited wives from exposing the secrets of their husbands. He said:\n\n‚ÄúThe worst of people in position before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who has intercourse with his wife and then spreads her secret.‚Äù [Muslim] i.e., describes it to others.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) also honoured women by prohibiting husbands from assuming evil about their wives or suspicion of them. Jabir (RA) reported:\n\n‚ÄúThe Messenger of Allah (Peace be upon him) prohibited men from surprising their wives by night, suspecting betrayal or seeking to catch their faults.‚Äù [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]\n\nAs for the conduct of Allah‚Äôs Messenger (Peace be upon him) with his own wives, it was of the utmost sensitivity and kindness. Al-Aswad reported:\n\n‚ÄúI asked Aisha how the Prophet (Peace be upon him) was with his wives. She said, ‚ÄòHe (Peace be upon him) was in the occupation of his wife,‚Äô meaning that he assisted her in her work. ‚ÄòBut when it was time for the prayer he would get up for prayer.‚Äù [Al-Bukhari]\n\nHe (Peace be upon him) would try to please his wives and amuse them with pleasant conversation and sweet words. An example is when he said to Aisha, ‚ÄúI know your anger and your contentment.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúHow do you know that, O Messenger of Allah?‚Äù He (Peace be upon him) said, ‚ÄúWhen you are content you say, ‚ÄòYes, by the Lord of Muhammad.‚Äô But when you are angry you say, ‚ÄòNo, by the Lord of Ibrahim.'‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúYes, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah; I do not abandon except your name.‚Äù [AlBukhari and Muslim]\n\nShe meant that her love of him was firm in her heart and did not change.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) never forgot his wife, Khadijah after her death. Anas (RA) reported:\n\n‚ÄúWhen the Prophet (Peace be upon him) got a gift he would say, ‚ÄòTake it to so-and-so, for she was a friend of Khadijah.‚Äù [At-Tabarani]\n\nDear servants of Allah! This is how our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) honoured women, so how do those who call for the ‚Äúliberation of women‚Äù compare to it?\n\nAll praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Prayers, peace and mercy are upon our beloved master, Muhammad, the son of Abdullah (Peace be upon him), his family and Companions.\n\nMurtadha Muhammad Gusau is the Chief Imam of Nagazi-Uvete Jumu‚Äôah and the late Alhaji Abdur-Rahman Okene‚Äôs Mosques, Okene, Kogi State, Nigeria.

      "title": "Culture of Nigeria",
      "content": "The culture of Nigeria is shaped by Nigeria's multiple ethnic groups. The country has 527 languages, seven of which are extinct. Nigeria also has over 1,150 dialects and ethnic groups. The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausas that are predominantly in the north, the Yorubas who predominate in the southwest, and the Igbos in the southeast. There are many other ethnic groups with sizeable populations across the different parts of the country. The Kanuri people are located in the northeast part of Nigeria, the Tiv people are in the north central, and the Efik-Ibibio are in the south South. \nThe Bini people are most frequent in the region between Yorubaland and Igboland.\nNigeria's other ethnic groups, sometimes called 'minorities', are found throughout the country but especially in the north and the middle belt. The traditionally nomadic Fulani can be found all over West and Central Africa. The Fulani and the Hausa are almost entirely Muslim, while the Igbo are almost completely Christian and so are the Bini and the Ibibio. The Yoruba make up about 21% of the country's population (estimated to be over 225 million) and are predominantly Christians and Muslims on equal footing, with a notable presence of traditionalists. Indigenous religious practices remain important to all of Nigeria's ethnic groups however, and frequently these beliefs are blended with Christian or Muslim beliefs, a practice known as syncretism.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Major ethnic cultures ==\n\n\n=== Bini culture ===\n \nSource:\nThe Binis, also called the Edo people, are a people of the South South region of modern Nigeria; they are said to be around 3.8 million as of the 21st century. They are ruled by monarchs, and are famous for their Benin Bronzes. In the pre-colonial period, they controlled a powerful empire. They are an ethnic group that is primarily found in Edo State, and spread across the Delta, Ondo, and Rivers states of Nigeria in smaller concentrations. The language they speak is called the Edo language. The Bini people are closely related to several other ethnic groups, that usually speak Edo languages, for example the Esan, however it is important to address the fact that the name \"Benin\" (and \"Bini\") is a Portuguese corruption, which came from the word \"Ubinu\", which came into use during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, C. 1440. The word \"Ubinu\" was used to depict and portray the royal administrative centre or capital proper of the kingdom, Edo. The word \"Ubinu\" was later corrupted to Bini by a number of mixed ethnicities staying together at the centre, and it was then further corrupted to Benin around the year 1485 at the time when the Portuguese people started making trade relations with Oba Ewuare.\n\n\n=== Hausa-Fulani Culture ===\n \nSource:\nThe Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups are said to be one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, if not the largest, with a population of over 20 million people. The Hausa and Fulani live in the northern part of Nigeria. They are both different tribes, but are often counted as one due to cultural similarity. The bulk of the Hausa-Fulani population is mainly centered in and around the central of Sokoto, Kano and Katsina, which are said to be important market centers on the southern area of the trans-Saharan caravan trade routes.\nLong before the arrival of the Fulani people, the Hausa had already formed and made well-organised city states; some of these states includes Katsina, Daura, Kano, Zazzau (Zaria), Biram, Gobir and Borno. However, some of these states were conquered, taken over and re-established by the Fulani people which then led to the formation of a few other kingdoms such as Katagum, Hadejia and Gombe. The arrival of the Fulani people into Hausaland brought about great changes in the land, which included the reformation of Islam. This then ended up playing a significant role in the social life and culture of the Hausa people. In education, dress and taste, the Hausa people and their counterparts the Fulani have become a significant part of the Islamic world; this said influence still remains until the current day. The Fulani practice the art of whipping a suitor before giving his bride to him as part of their marriage obligation. This particular obligation has helped to increase the practice of monogamy among themselves, and it is called Sharo. The Fulani people are also nomadic in nature; this nomadic lifestyle spread them into virtually all of West Africa. They are extremely tolerant of the languages of other people around them, leading to the suppression of theirs - especially in northern Nigeria by Hausa.\nThe Hausas, on the other hand, are said to be very good merchants. This helped spread them to some areas around Nigeria. They have monarchs, are known for celebrating the Hawan Sallah festival, and are also followers of the religious teachings of Sheikh Usman dan Fodio.\n\n\n=== Igbo culture ===\n \nSource:\nThe Igbo people, commonly and often referred to as Ibo people, are one of the largest ethnic groups to ever exist in Africa; they have a total population of about 20 million people. Most people who are a part of this ethnic group are based in the southeastern part of Nigeria, they contribute to about 17 percent of the country's population. They can also be found in large numbers in Cameroon and other African countries. It is believed that the Igbo people originated in an area that is about 100 miles north of their current location at the confluence of the Niger and Benue Rivers. The Igbo people share linguistic ties with their neighbours the Bini, Igala, and Idoma, with whom it is believed they were closely related until five to six thousand years ago. The first Igbo in the region may have moved onto the Awka-Orlu plateau between four and five thousand years ago. The eastern part of Nigeria is the home of the Igbos, who are mostly Christians. Their traditional religion is known as Omenani/Omenala. Both concepts, each an aspect of a single whole, aspire to protect and preserve the purity, sanctity and sacredness of the land and the people therein. 'Omenana' is man-made; it is easily changed and is adaptable. 'Odinana', on the contrary, is a code of life, handed down from Chukwu, God the Creator, to Eri, the patriarch of the Igbo race, to prevent chaos and confusion. The earth spirit, Ana, is 'Odinana', as is the sacred role of yam in the Igbo world, the right of inheritance, and the place of the elder. 'Odinana', as the immutable customary rites and traditions of the Igbo world, is enduring and cuts across indigenous Igbo people, while 'Omenana' is rather relative from one section of the Igbo to the other. Socially, the Igbos are led by monarchs who had limited power historically. These figures are expected to confer subordinate titles upon men and women that are highly accomplished. This is known as the Nze na Ozo title system. \n\n\n=== Ijaw culture ===\n \nThe Ijaw people are said to be a collection of people that are native to the Niger Delta area in Nigeria. Owing to the affinity they have with water, a significant number of the Ijaw people are discovered as migrant fishermen in camps that are as far west as Sierra Leone and as far east as Gabon. With a population of about 4 million, the Ijaws inhabit the Niger Delta section and they make up about 1.8% of Nigeria's population. From a historical perspective, it is almost impossible to give a precise and accurate account as to when and where the Ijaws originated; numerous different accounts have been given by many historians regarding this issue, but what is certain is that the Ijaws are one of the world's most ancient peoples. The Ijaw people are said by some to be the descendants of the autochthonous people of Africa known as the (H)oru.  The Ijaws were originally known by this name (Oru); at least it was what their immediate neighbours assumed them to be. Although this was a very long time ago, the Ijaws have, however, kept the ancient language and culture of the Orus. Being the first to find a settlement in the Lower Niger and Niger Delta, it is possible that they may have started inhabiting this region as far back as 500 BC.\nLanguage and cultural studies suggest that they are related to the founders of the Nile Valley civilization complex (and possibly the Lake Chad complex). They immigrated to West Africa from the Nile Valley during antiquity. The Ijaw culture of the South has been influenced greatly by its location on the coast and the interaction with foreigners that it necessitated. Its members amassed great wealth while serving as middlemen, and the preponderance of English names among them today is a testament to the trade names adopted by their ancestors at this time.\n\n\n=== Yoruba culture ===\n\nSource:\nThe Yoruba people are said to be one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, alongside the Igbo and the Hausa-Fulani peoples. They are concentrated in the southwestern section of Nigeria, much smaller and scattered groups of Yoruba people live in Benin and northern Togo and they are numbered to be more than 20 million at the turn of the 21st century. The Yoruba people have always shared a common language called the Yoruba language and have had the same culture for hundreds of years now, but historically they were less likely to be a single political unit prior to the colonial period. The Yoruba people are believed to have migrated from the east to their present lands west of the lower Niger River more than a millennium ago. They eventually became the most urbanized Africans of precolonial times. The Yoruba people eventually formed many kingdoms of various sizes, each of which was centered on a capital city or town and was ruled by a hereditary king known as an Oba. Their towns eventually became more and more populated and grew into the present-day cities of Oyo, Ile-Ife, Ilesha, Ibadan, Ilorin, Ijebu-Ode, Ikere-Ekiti, and others. Oyo developed in the medieval and early modern periods into the largest of the Yoruba kingdoms, while Ile-Ife still remained a town of very strong religious significance as the site of the earth's creation according to Yoruba mythology. Oyo and the other kingdoms declined in the late 18th and 19th centuries owing to disputes among minor Yoruba rulers and invasions by the Fon of Dahomey (now Benin Republic) and the Muslim Fulani. The traditional Yoruba kingships still survive, but with only a hint of their former political power. These monarchs have titled individuals that serve beneath them, with most of this latter group making up the membership of the Ogboni secret society. Their traditional religion, Ifa, has been recognized by UNESCO as a masterpiece of the oral tradition of Humanity.\n\n\n== Nigerian upper class ==\n \n\nEver since the country's earliest centralization - under the Nokites at a time contemporaneous to the birth of Jesus Christ - Nigeria has been ruled by a class of titled potentates that are known as chiefs. Led by the Nigerian traditional rulers (i.e. monarchs who have received definite authority from the official government and are recognized by the laws of Nigeria), the chiefs come in various ranks and are of varied kinds - some monarchs are so powerful that they influence political and religious life outside their immediate domains (the Sultan of Sokoto and the Ooni of Ife, for example), while in contrast many local families around the country install their eldest members as titled chiefs in order for them to provide them with what is an essentially titular leadership.\nAlthough chiefs have few official powers today, they are widely respected, and prominent monarchs are often courted to endorse politicians during elections in the hopes of them conferring legitimacy to their campaigns by way of doing so. Successful Nigerians, such as businessmen and the said politicians, typically themselves aspire to the holding of chieftaincies, and the monarchs' control of the honours system that provides them serves as an important royal asset.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n \n \nNigeria is famous for its English language literature. Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, is an important book in African literature. With over eight million copies sold worldwide, it has been translated into 50 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time.\nNigerian Nobel laureate ‚ÄîWole Soyinka described the work as \"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him.\" Nigeria has other notable writers of English language literature. These include Femi Osofisan, whose first published novel, Kolera Kolej, was produced in 1975; Ben Okri, whose first work, The Famished Road, was published in 1991, and Buchi Emecheta, who wrote stories drawn from her personal experiences of gender inequity that promote viewing women through a single prism of the ability to marry and have children. Helon Habila, Sefi Atta, Flora Nwapa, Iquo Diana Abasi Eke, Zaynab Alkali and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, among others, are notable Nigerian authors whose works are read widely within and outside the country.\nApart from the speakers of standard English, a large portion of the population, roughly a third, speaks Nigerian pidgin, which has a primarily English lexicon. It has become a common lingua franca as a result. Pidgin English is a creolized form of the language. For instance, \"How you dey\" means \"How are you\". The Palm Wine Drinkard, a popular novel by Amos Tutuola, was written in it.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\nSince the 1990s the Nigerian movie industry, sometimes called \"Nollywood\", has emerged as a fast-growing cultural force all over Africa. Vast wealth has been generated by it, and it is currently the second-largest film industry in the world by output.\nBecause of the movies, western influences such as music, casual dressing and methods of speaking are to be found all across Nigeria, even in the highly conservative north of the country.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe Nigerian national football team, nicknamed the \"Super Eagles\", is the national team of Nigeria, run by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). According to the FIFA World Rankings, Nigeria ranks 42nd and holds the sixth-highest place among the African nations. The highest position Nigeria ever reached on the ranking was 5th, in April 1994.\nSupporters of English football clubs like Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea often segregate beyond the traditional tribal and even religious divide to share their common cause in Premier League teams.\nOther than football, basketball, handball and volleyball are also prominent in the Nigerian sports sector. Indigenous games such as loofball, dambe and ayo also have significant popularity among youths in Nigeria.\nNigeria is the country of origin for the sport Loofball. The game involves two teams of five, a ball, and a net. It is played by tossing the ball over the net to the opposing team's side of the court. After July 2021, the sport has been administered by the LSDI (Loofball Sports Development Initiative).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n== Food ==\n\nNigerian food offers a rich blend of traditionally African carbohydrates such as yam and cassava as well as the vegetable soups with which they are often served. Maize is another crop that is commonly grown in Nigeria. Praised by Nigerians for the strength it gives, garri is \"the number one staple carbohydrate food item in Nigeria\",\na powdered cassava grain that can be readily eaten as a meal and is quite inexpensive. Yams are frequently eaten either fried in oil or pounded to make a mashed potato-like yam pottage. Nigerian beans, quite different from green peas, are widely popular. Meat is also popular and Nigerian suya‚Äîa barbecue-like roasted meat‚Äîis a well-known delicacy. Bushmeat, meat from wild game like antelope and duikers, is also popular. Fermented palm products make a traditional liquor, palm wine, and also fermented cassava. Nigerian foods are spicy, mostly in the western and southern part of the country, even more so than in Indian cuisine. Other examples of their traditional dishes are eba, pounded yam, iyan, fufu and soups like okra, ogbono and egusi. Fufu is so emblematic of Nigeria that it figures in Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, for example.\nNigeria is known for its many traditional dishes. Each tribe has different dishes that are unique to their culture. Yoruba people, for example, have different dishes like Amala, Ogbono, Moin Moin, Ofada Rice, and Efo Riro.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe music of Nigeria includes many kinds of folk and popular music, some of which are known worldwide. The singer and social activist Fela Kuti was instrumental in Nigeria's musical development. His personalized sound, dubbed Afrobeat, is now one of the continent's most widely recognised genres.\nTraditional musicians use a number of diverse instruments, such as Gongon drums. The kora and the kakaki are also important.\nOther traditional cultural expressions are found in the various masquerades of Nigeria, such as the Eyo masquerades of Lagos, the Ekpe and Ekpo masquerades of the Efik/Ibibio/Annang/Igbo people of the South-South and southeastern Nigeria, and the Northern masquerades of the Bini. The most popular Yoruba manifestations of this custom are the Gelede masquerades.\n\n\n== Clothing ==\n\nWomen wear long flowing robes and headscarves made by local makers who dye and weave the fabric locally. Southern Nigerian women choose to wear western-style clothing. People in urban regions of Nigeria dress in western style, the youth mainly wearing jeans and T-shirts.  Other Nigerian men and women typically wear a traditional style called Buba. For men the loose-fitting shirt goes down to halfway down the thigh. For women, the loose-fitting blouse goes down a little below the waist. Other clothing gear includes a gele, which is the woman's headgear. For men their traditional cap is called fila.\nHistorically, Nigerian fashion incorporated many different types of fabrics. Cotton has been used for over 500 years for fabric-making in Nigeria. Silk (called tsamiya in Hausa, sanyan in Yoruba, and akpa-obubu in Igbo) is also used. Perhaps the most popular fabric used in Nigerian fashion is Dutch wax print, produced in the Netherlands. The import market for this fabric is dominated by the Dutch company Vlisco, which has been selling its Dutch wax print fabric to Nigerians since the late 1800s, when the fabric was sold along the company's oceanic trading route to Indonesia. Since then, Nigerian and African patterns, colour schemes, and motifs have been incorporated into Vlisco's designs to become a staple of the brand.\nNigeria has over 250 ethnic groups and as a result, a wide variety of traditional clothing styles. In the Yoruba tradition, women wear an iro (wrapper), buba (loose shirt) and gele (head-wrap). The men wear buba (long shirt), sokoto (baggy trousers), agbada (flowing robe with wide sleeves) and fila (a hat). In the Igbo tradition, the men's cultural attire is Isiagu (a patterned shirt), which is worn with trousers and the traditional Igbo men's hat called Okpu Agwu. The women wear a puffed sleeved blouse, two wrappers and a headwrap. Hausa men wear barbarigas or kaftans (long flowing gowns) with tall decorated hats. The women wear wrappers and shirts and cover their heads with hijabs (veils).\n\n\n== Oral tradition ==\nOral traditions in Nigeria  are part of a form of human communication in which knowledge, art ideas, and cultural materials are acquired, conserved, and conveyed orally from one generation to another. It is one of the earliest works from Nigeria put into writing and entails several genres of indigenous knowledge production communicated to its adherents verbally. It also encompasses the transmission of historical and artistic information from an initial witness through generation (the information is handled by skilled oral historians).\nTraditions have evolved along with the societies and cultures that produced them. Oral traditions in Nigeria have played a very important role in preserving and transmitting historical information and its various functions. Historical information is usually transmitted through speech, songs, folktales, prose, chants, and ballads. Oral traditions in Nigeria are commonly used as a means of keeping the past alive.\n\n\n== University culture in Nigeria ==\nNigerian university culture encompasses a tapestry of academic pursuit, social engagement, and cultural diversity. Renowned for its rigorous academic standards, Nigerian university institutions provide an academic environment where students are challenged to excel in different academic fields. The academic rigor plays an important role in the cornerstone of the university experience intertwined with its very own grading system unique to Nigerian universities. \n\nBeyond the lecture halls and laboratories, Nigerian university campuses come alive with a vibrant array of extracurricular activities and social events such as sports tournaments and talent shows to cultural festivals and academic symposiums, rag days. With some often being hosted by different clubs such as the Rotaract Club, and even religious club groups such as the Christian church youth groups. At the heart of Nigerian university culture lies a tradition of student activism and social advocacy. Students are often at the forefront of movements advocating for social justice, political reform, and educational equity through protests, demonstrations, and advocacy campaigns. Students raise concerns and demand accountability from those in positions of power through these methods.                                                                                   One of the most known traditional markers of Nigerian university culture is the sign-out day tradition, which is an annual tradition observed in Nigerian universities. Sign-out day is a day for celebrating the last day of the final year session by wearing white clothing. The tradition is celebrated with a white T-shirt or any white shirt worn by a graduating student. The shirts are then to be signed by friends and well-wishers. This tradition marks the culmination of academic studies for graduating students. For university students, this ceremonial event holds significant cultural and social importance within the Nigerian higher education system, symbolizing the completion of undergraduate studies and the transition to the next phase of life.\nDespite the numerous challenges facing Nigerian universities, including inadequate funding, violent cult-related confraternities, infrastructure deficiencies, and the occasional strikes, students navigate these obstacles with a different array of resolve, driven by their thirst for a better future. Furthermore, the cultural diversity of Nigeria, with its myriad ethnic groups, languages, and traditions, is vividly reflected on university campuses. Students from diverse backgrounds come together, sharing their unique perspectives and experiences, and enriching the academic and social fabric of the Nigerian university community.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchitecture of Nigeria\nFestivals in Nigeria\nGender roles and fluidity in indigenous Nigerian cultures\nList of museums in Nigeria\nMusic of Nigeria\nNok culture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRoss, Will. \"Nigeria's thriving art and music scene.\" (Archive) BBC. 20 November 2013.\n\"Interesting Facts About Nigerian People and Culture\".

      "title": "Ekinrin-Adde",
      "content": "Ekinrin-Adde is a town located in Ijumu L.G.A. of Kogi State, in the Western Senatorial District of Nigeria on latitude 7¬∞ 50‚ÄôN and longitude 5¬∞ 50‚ÄôE at an altitude of 523 metres above sea level.\nThe town is a conglomerate of contiguous villages that amalgamated into one. The people trace their ancestry to Ile-Ife, the cradle of Yoruba civilization. The people are a sub-ethnic group within the Yoruba nationality, who speak a dialect generally referred to as Okun, widely spoken by the five local Government that make up the Kogi West Senatorial District although with slight variation from community to community. The Okun dialect is a sub-dialect of the Yoruba language.\n\n\n== History ==\nEkinrin-Adde was very important in the economic activities of Okun land during the pre-colonial era. There existed some economic activities such as hunting, fishing, agriculture, trade and commerce.\n\n\n== Location ==\nEkinrin-Adde is located in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi state and bordered by Iyamoye and Egbeda Egga. Ekinrin-Adde is 20 minutes drive from Ekiti state and shares other cultures with villages on the same axis.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Ekinrin-Adde people are united by several practices such as Egungun (masquerade) festival. Masquerades usually parade during a particular season and also when an eminent person who holds or who is in a position of authority dies. Notable masquerades includes the Olori Owo or Iro masquerades (women are forbidden from seeing them) and it belongs to the Ekinrin aboriginals. Iro masquerade is as old as Ekinrin itself as it was created by Akinrin himself. There is also Oyoyo (comes out during the Emindin festival) and the Ajibele, Ajoriga masquerade. Other masquerades includes Onigabon, Inun Oko and Okura (Okura appear to have gone into extinction).\nAnother cultural festival usually carried out on the 20th day of June every year is the Emindin festival. The ‚ÄúEmindin‚Äù festival is usually called out by the Omo Agba people from Ona the royal clan.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe general nature of Ekinrin-Adde land is predominantly Savannah with undulating plains. There are deep hills, which marks the eastern and western edge. The soil is light brown, sandy and a little lateritic on the plain stony soil in the hills with rare patches of red earth. Due to the nature of the soil, most of the residents are farmers and common farm produce include yam, cassava, pepper, beans, cocoyam, melon and palm oil.\n\n\n== Natural resources and tourist attraction ==\nEkinrin-Adde is very rich in white marble. The marble deposit in Ekinrin-Adde, based on its chemical composition is a pure carbonate and a typical calcitic-type marble. The marble deposit in Ekinrin-Adde is suitable for the manufacture of cement, production of sodium alkalis (sodium carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide), pesticide, poultry feed, calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer and as a refractory lime.\nNotable tourist spots include the Akogba hill (1000m above sea level) and Oyi river.\n\nThe Akogba radio FM (88.3)  residing near the Akogba Hill, is the first private community FM in Okun and serves the purpose of ensuring the people of Ijumu, parts of Kabba Bunu and even neighbouring states are well informed about happenings in Kogi, Nigeria and the world at large.\n\n\n== EULOGY ==\nEmidin Festival is the annual new yam festival of the Ekinrin people. Emidin festival is usually celebrated in June. In the very old days, barns of yams shows the wealth of a person, someone with a large collection of yams marked prestige. \nFrom planting till harvest, the process of farming yam is taken sacred by the Ekinrin-Adde's culture. Around June, the first yams are harvested and celebrated by the people. Men would dig up their first yams for display and the farmers with the biggest yams are often admired. After the celebration, the yams are cooked or roasted with the women guiding the procession.\n\nThis festival also serves as a period to thank the gods for a bountiful harvest and also to ask for abundant rains for the next planting season. It's a common practice for most indigenes of the town to return home to celebrate, meet their family members and also an age group reunion opportunity. \nAccording to tradition, it is unacceptable for the community member to eat new yam before the celebration.\n\n Other festivals are Idi Festival, Ok·∫πl·∫πk·∫πl·∫π festival and a new festival for hiking the Akogba Mountain. The Akogba Mountain is one of the natural endowments of Ekinrin-Adde. A giant Monolith sitting in a pristine state in the north-west of the community overlooking the town as well as being the source of the mysterious Akogba Spring. Although it's not the only Mountain surrounding this beautiful community, it's arguably the most prominent at an alititude of about 3500 feet(1050m above sea level)\n\n\n== Education ==\nEkinrin-Adde has various primary and secondary schools. Most of the old ones were established through communal efforts and by collaboration with early missionaries. Among the very notable ones is Baptist High School, established by the community in conjunction with the missionary John B. Hill.\n\n\n== Kings and traditional rulers ==\nEkinrin-Adde is the only community in the entire Kogi state with two first class Kings serving the community.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAbiodun Faleke - Politician and a member of Nigeria's House of Representatives of Lagos\nOlayemi Akinwunmi - Vice Chancellor, Federal University, Lokoja\n\n\n== References ==",

The purpose of wearing the dress can be to serve as self-identification with age mates, relatives or friends during social occasions or funerals.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe word A·π£o in Yoruba means cloth and ·∫∏b√≠ denotes family group. As·ªç-·∫∏b√≠ can be described as a family dress code usually worn in uniforms during family ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, birthdays & anniversaries. The practice has now spread beyond family dressing because well-wishers of a celebrant can wear the As·ªç-·∫∏b√≠. As·ªç-·∫∏b√≠ is also acculturated by other ethnic groups in Nigeria, especially in the South East and South-South of Nigeria due to its colorful culture and popularity as well.\nAyodele Olukoju, a Nigerian economic historian, believes As·ªç-·∫∏b√≠ became a novelty in 1920 during a period of post-World War I economic boom triggered by the higher prices for products such as oil palm. William Bascom traced the origin to an earlier period when members of Yoruba age grade wore uniform dress to mark fraternal bonds. In the 1950s, members of women's organizations or egbes turned out to ceremonies and anniversaries of relatives in the same style of dress, sandals, lappa, smock, or necklace; the culture signifies close friendship. The uniform dressing can also be a measure of personal affluence because aso ebi involves rivalry between various egbes or groups with each group competing to outshine each other in terms of quality, originality and richness of the uniform.\n\n\n== 1960s and beyond ==\nFrom the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, imported lace and george were incorporated into Nigerian fabrics and they became popular items used for aso ebi. Increased demand for handcrafted traditional dresses such as agbada led to a resurgence of tailors and fashion designers specializing in making native attires. The tailors strived to meet the increasing demand and designs of uniform dressing, sometimes with the aid of the fashion pages of magazines to make style choices. The rise of aso ebi also coincided with an intense market of fashion and lifestyle magazines in Lagos; tailors look at designs for inspiration and their patrons buy the magazines to see whether they or their friends are pictured in them. Okechukwu Nwafor has shown how aso ebi is a consequence of Lagos cosmopolitanism whereby its fashioning is largely tied to a dialogue between photographers, fashion magazines, vendors, and tailors in urban Lagos.  In recent times, the extent of social expansiveness that has befallen aso ebi is such that both a stranger and an uninvited guest might seek recognition through aso ebi. The increasing eagerness of guests to don aso ebi stems from the special recognition bestowed upon those who do. This underscores the notion that at most social gatherings in Nigeria, aso ebi is held in higher regard than anything else, even the food.\nAso ebi in recent times has become a city phenomenon that has spread to other West African cultures. For example, in Sierra Leone and Cameroon aso ebi is rephrased as Ashobi with many participants unaware of its Yoruba origins. Dealers of imported and local textile materials have benefited from the boom in demand for uniform dressing. Some textile dealers offer consultation services and bulk rates for the choice and cost of the dress and fabrics. While the price of fabrics in sewing the traditional attire is affordable, the aso ebi practice is still sometimes used as an identification with affluence. Some wear expensive embroidery and extra layers of cloth, whereas others, who cannot afford a whole outfit, add only matching tops and head coverings. Aso ebi has become an attire of class worn by celebrities and elites in recent times, especially Nigerian Nollywood stars. With fashion designers creatively making outfits for special occasions to meet the taste of their wealthy customers, aso ebi outfits have become a regular occurrence today. \n\n\n== References ==",

It is a massive homecoming whereby Igbo women in the diaspora and the cities travel back to their matrimonial villages to meet with their local counterparts to discuss matters about the community development, conflict management, human development, and other socio-economic and cultural initiatives.\nThe meeting is a three days ritual and it is divided into three parts, the first is held at the village level, the second within the community, and the third is held in churches where thanksgivings are held to mark the end of the meeting.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of the August meeting can be traced back to the 1940s, possibly influenced by Church Missionary Societies that aimed to empower women's voices. The timing of the meeting is significant. August coincides with the end of the farming season, a time of rest when schools are also on break. This allows Igbo women, both those residing in their hometowns and those who have migrated to cities or abroad, to conveniently return home and participate in the annual congress.\n\n\n== Challenges ==\n\nIn the early years of the August meeting, the rich and influential women used the avenue of the August meeting to intimidate other women by wearing expensive clothing, wrappers, and jewelry. This act made a number of women to lose interest and discouraged them from attending and consequently the turn out for the meeting dropped in various communities. A lot of marriages also failed as wives mounted pressure on their husbands to get the latest clothing and wrapper for the August Meeting. \nThis issue was addressed when the decision was taken that women should appear in prechosen uniforms, which put an end to the pressure and competition.\n\n\n== Cinematography ==\nA stage play titled August Meeting was performed in 2018 at the Lagos Theatre Festival.

      "title": "Clouding of consciousness",
      "content": "Clouding of consciousness, also called brain fog or mental fog, occurs when a person is conscious but slightly less wakeful or aware than normal. They are less aware of time and their surroundings, and find it difficult to pay attention. People describe this subjective sensation as their mind being \"foggy\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe term clouding of consciousness has always denoted the main pathogenetic feature of delirium since physician Georg Greiner pioneered the term (Verdunkelung des Bewusstseins) in 1817. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)  has historically used the term in its definition of delirium. The DSM-III-R and the DSM-IV replaced \"clouding of consciousness\" with \"disturbance of consciousness\" to make it easier to operationalize, but it is still fundamentally the same thing. Clouding of consciousness may be less severe than delirium on a spectrum of abnormal consciousness. Clouding of consciousness may be synonymous with subsyndromal delirium.\nSubsyndromal delirium differs from normal delirium by being overall less severe, lacking acuteness in onset and duration, having a relatively stable sleep-wake cycle, and having relatively stable motor alterations. Subsyndromal delirium's significant clinical features are inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities. Delirium's full clinical manifestations may never be reached. Among intensive care unit patients, subsyndromal subjects were as likely to survive as patients with a Delirium Screening Checklist score of 0, but required extended care at rates greater than 0-scoring patients (although lower rates than those with full ICU delirium) as well as having a decreased post-discharge level of functional independence vs. the general population, but still more independence than full delirium.\nIn clinical practice, no standard test is exclusive and specific; therefore, the diagnosis depends on the physician's subjective impression. The DSM-IV-TR instructs clinicians to code subsyndromal delirium presentations under the miscellaneous category \"cognitive disorder not otherwise specified\".\n\n\n== Psychopathology ==\nThe conceptual model of clouding of consciousness in psychopathology is that of a part of the brain regulating the \"overall level\" of consciousness, which is responsible for awareness of oneself and of the environment. Various etiologies disturb this regulating part of the brain, which in turn disturbs the \"overall level\" of consciousness. This system of a sort of general activation of consciousness is called \"arousal\" or \"wakefulness\".\nIt is not necessarily accompanied by drowsiness. Patients may be awake (not sleepy) yet still have a clouded consciousness (disorder of wakefulness). Paradoxically, affected individuals say that they are \"awake but, in another way, not\". Lipowski points out that decreased \"wakefulness\" as used here is not exactly synonymous with drowsiness. One is a stage on the way to coma, the other on the way to sleep, which is very different.\nThe affected person has a sensation of mental clouding described in the patient's own words as \"foggy\". One patient said, \"I thought it became like misty, in some way... the outlines were sort of fuzzy\". Others may describe a \"spaced-out\" feeling. Affected people compare their overall experience to that of a dream, because, as in a dream, consciousness, attention, orientation to time and place, perceptions, and awareness are disturbed. Barbara Schildkrout, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School, described her subjective experience of clouding of consciousness, which she also called \"mental fog\", after taking a single dose of chlorpheniramine (an antihistamine for her allergy to cottonwood) on a cross-country road trip. She described feeling \"out of it\" and being in a \"dreamy state\". She described a sense of not trusting her own judgment and a dulled awareness, not knowing how much time had passed. Clouding of consciousness is not the same thing as depersonalization, though people affected by both compare their experience to that of a dream. Psychometric tests produce little evidence of a relationship between clouding of consciousness and depersonalization.\nBrain fog may affect performance on virtually any cognitive task. As one author put it, \"It should be apparent that cognition is not possible without a reasonable degree of arousal.\" Cognition includes perception, memory, learning, executive functions, language, constructive abilities, voluntary motor control, attention, and mental speed. Brain fog's most significant clinical features are inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities. The extent of the impairment is variable because inattention may impair several cognitive functions. Affected people may complain of forgetfulness, being \"confused\", or being \"unable to think straight\". Despite the similarities, subsyndromal delirium is not the same thing as mild cognitive impairment; the fundamental difference is that mild cognitive impairment is a dementia-like impairment, which does not involve a disturbance in arousal (wakefulness).\n\n\n== In diseases ==\nThe term \"brain fog\" is used to represent a subjective condition of perceived cognitive impairment. It is defined as \"a phenomenon of fluctuating states of perceived cognitive dysfunction that could have implications in the functional application of cognitive skills in people's participation in daily activities\". Brain fog is a common symptom in many illnesses where chronic pain is a major component. Brain fog affects 15% to 40% of those with chronic pain as their major illness. In such illnesses, pain processing may use up resources, decreasing the brain's ability to think effectively.\nMany people with fibromyalgia experience cognitive problems (known as \"fibrofog\" or \"brainfog\"), which may involve impaired concentration, problems with short- and long-term memory, short-term memory consolidation, working memory, impaired speed of performance, inability to multitask, cognitive overload, and diminished attention span. About 75% of fibromyalgia patients report significant problems with concentration, memory, and multitasking. A 2018 meta-analysis found that the largest differences between fibromyalgia patients and healthy subjects were for inhibitory control, memory, and processing speed. Many of these are also common symptoms of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and studies have linked the two conditions, to the point that a fibromyalgia diagnosis has been proposed as an indication to screen for ADHD. It is alternatively hypothesized that the increased pain compromises attention systems, resulting in cognitive problems.\nIn chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, the CDC's recommended criteria for diagnosis include that one of the following symptoms must be present:\n\nProblems with thinking and memory (cognitive dysfunction, sometimes described as \"brain fog\")\nWhile standing or sitting upright, lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness, fainting, or vision changes may occur (orthostatic intolerance)\nLyme disease's neurologic syndrome, called Lyme encephalopathy, is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, among other issues. Lyme can cause a chronic encephalomyelitis that resembles multiple sclerosis. It may be progressive and can involve cognitive impairment, migraines, balance problems, and other symptoms.\nBrain fog is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, with a survey showing that 79.2% of those with the condition reported experiencing brain fog to some extent, either selecting the option for \"frequently\" or \"all the time\". While it is unclear how the disease leads to brain fog, proper treatment with levothyroxine has been shown to reduce cognitive impairment.\nCognitive disengagement syndrome was implicated in the expression of brain fog symptoms.\nPatients recovering from COVID-19 report experiencing brain fog, which can reflect a wide variety of neurological and psychological symptoms linked to COVID-19.\nBrain fog and other neurological symptoms may also result from mold exposure. This may be due to mycotoxin exposure and consequent innate immune system activation and inflammation, including in the central nervous system. But adverse neurological health effects of mold exposure are controversial due to inadequate research and data, and more research is needed in this area.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",
      "summary": "Clouding of consciousness, also called brain fog or mental fog, occurs when a person is conscious but slightly less wakeful or aware than normal. They are less aware of time and their surroundings, and find it difficult to pay attention. People describe this subjective sensation as their mind being \"foggy\".",

      "title": "Culture of Northern Nigeria",
      "content": "The culture of Northern Nigeria is mostly dominated by the culture of the Fourteen Kingdoms that dominated the region in prehistoric times, but these cultures are also deeply influenced by the culture of over one hundred ethnic groups that still live in the region.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nNorthern Nigeria inherited much of the literary legacy of the old Sudanic states. The Hausa Sultanates from the 9th to the 18th century produced numerous literary works. Thousands of such works mostly in Ajami, Hausa and Arabic still remain uncatalogued throughout Northern Nigeria.\nSince the colonisation by the British Empire, English and the Latin script has superseded the Ajami script. Abubakr Imam Kagara is regarded as one of the fathers of modern Northern Nigerian literature, His works such as Ruwan Bagaja and Magana Jari Ce, published in the 1930s, served as a bridge between the old Sudanic literary tradition and western ways. \nOthers such as Yabo Lari and Muhammed Sule ‚Äì author of The Undesirable Element ‚Äì made equally important contributions in the 1960s. In the 1980s popular authors including Abubakar Gimba and Zaynab Alkali served to keep the North's literary tradition alive and distinct from the Nigerian south.\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of authors from Abubakar Othman, Ismail Bala and Ahmed Maiwada in poetry to Maria Ajima and Victor Dugga in drama. Contemporary Northern Nigerian literature is mostly produced in Kano, Kaduna, Jos and Minna. Writers such as B. M. Dzukogi, Ismail Bala, Yusuf Adamu, Musa Okapnachi, Razinat Mohammed and E. E. Sule are still active.\n\n\n== Music ==\nWhile the old Sudanic tradition mostly concentrated on poetry and sung poetry, from the 1950s influx of British influence served to fertilise Northern Nigerian music. Dan Maraya Jos, Mamman Shata, Barmani Choge, Aliyu Dan Kwairo and a host of others are regarded as the founders of the distinct Northern Nigerian stylistic musical genre. Others such as Fatima Uji continue to be popular. Since the 1990s influence of pop culture has led to rise of Northern Nigerian R&B singers. Northern Nigerian singers including Adam Zango, Ice Prince Zamani, Idris Abdulkareem and King Bawa are popular throughout Africa.\n\n\n== Cinema ==\n\nNorthern Nigeria's movie industry, known as Hausa Cinema, was one of the first commercial film industries in sub-Saharan Africa.  The industry was created by veteran journalists and actors from Radio Kaduna and RTV Kaduna in the 1950s. Today actors such as Ali Nuhu, Adam A Zango, Sani Danja, and Ibrahim Maishukku are popular within the region. Since the 1990s and the slow rise of Islamic fundamentalism through the proselytizing campaigns of the Izala Society, Northern Nigerian cinema has witnessed considerable setbacks and has now been dwarfed by its Southern Nigerian counterpart.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Daybreak in Udi",
      "content": "Daybreak in Udi is a 1949 British documentary film directed by Terry Bishop about cultural changes in Udi, Enugu State, Nigeria. The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1950.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn 1949 Colonial Nigeria undergoes identity crisis, a clash between the progressive, educated elements of society - those who desire westernization and modernity- and traditionalists who want to maintain Nigerian heritage. Two young African teachers, Iruka and Dominic demand that Udi village should have a maternity home to serve as a symbol of progressiveness and modernization. The British District Officer, E.R. Chadwick, after some persuasion agrees to provide the resources for the project. Chadwick wants to ensure that everyone in the village is on board for the task, however, Eze, an elderly resident opposes the decision asserting that building the maternity home is both an affront to the tradition and culture of the village, and he persuades others towards his view.\nChadwick visits the village to convince the villagers and succeeds. Work on the maternity home begins. Although it will prove a long and arduous process, the villagers came together to construct the building but were interrupted by Eze, who arrives at the building site and claims that it is an old burial ground. He predicts that the builders will invoke the ire of the ancestors for disturbing the site and violating custom. Cultural values quickly manifest. Fear and superstition briefly stop the work, but Chadwick and Dominic arrive to allay the workers' fears and restart the building project. However, Eze‚Äôs threat looms large in the back of their minds.\nIn time the building is complete, but before it is set to officially open, a young woman and her husband arrive in the village. The woman is in labor, and so Chadwick and the midwife (Joyce MgBaronye) agree to admit the woman as the home's first patient. That evening, while tending the woman, the midwife catches sight of movement and hears noises coming from outside. Frightened, she soon hears a knock at the door, but it turns out only to be Iruka coming to check up on the expectant mother. Relieved, the midwife resumes her work while Iruka sets a pot of water to boil on the fire. Shortly thereafter, there is another noise, and when looking out the window the midwife spots a masked figure peering in. Believing the masked figure to be a spirit of the ancestors, the midwife cries out in fear, but Iruka throws the boiling water onto the figure, revealing Eze, who flees back into the surrounding overgrowth. \nThe next day the villagers march up to the maternity home for the opening ceremony, a traditional one complete with dancing, music, singing, and native costumes. Chadwick takes the center seat in front of the maternity home to watch the events, with Eze sitting near him. Eze has finally accepted that tradition and progress, as visible in the final scene, can go together after all. In the closing narration, Chadwick tells the viewer that progress brings \"power, spirit, unlimited and unknown possibilities and destinations\" and suggests that progress should be the ultimate goal of native society.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nE.R.

June 12 was formerly known as Abiola Day, celebrated in Lagos and some South-western states of Nigeria.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nNigeria gained independence from Great Britain on 1 October 1960. For most of its independent history, Nigeria was ruled by a series of military juntas, interspersed by brief moments of democratic rule (for example from 1979 to 1983 with Alhaji Shehu Shagari). The last major military ruler was Gen. Sani Abacha,  who died suddenly on Monday in 1998. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar promised a transition to democracy, and accordingly a new constitution was adopted on May 5, 1999. Elections were held and retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who had previously governed Nigeria as a military ruler, was elected the new president.\n\n\n=== Democracy Day ===\nMay 29 was initially the official democracy day in Nigeria, marking when the newly elected Olusegun Obasanjo took office as President of Nigeria. On June 6, 2018, eight days after May 29, 2018, had been celebrated as Democracy Day, the government of president Muhammadu Buhari declared June 12 to be the new Democracy Day. This was done to commemorate the democratic election of Moshood Abiola on June 12, 1993, which was wrongly cancelled by the government of Ibrahim Babangida. Abiola was later detained after he rightfully declared himself the president.\n\n\n== Others ==\nThe Nigerian Democracy Day theme song was written by Attih Soul on the directives of the Buhari led administration in 2017 as part of the celebration to mark the day.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDemocracy Day in other countries.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "History of Nigeria",
      "content": "The history of Nigeria can be traced to the earliest inhabitants whose date remains at least 13,000 BC through the early civilizations such as the Nok culture which began around 1500 BC. Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the Kingdom of Nri, the Benin Kingdom, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa Kingdom during the 11th century, while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal to the Kingdom of Warri. The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. Through contact with Europeans, early harbour towns such as Calabar, Badagry and Bonny emerged along the coast after 1480, which did business in the transatlantic slave trade, among other things. Conflicts in the hinterland, such as the civil war in the Oyo Empire, meant that new enslaved people were constantly being \"supplied\".\nAfter 1804, Usman dan Fodio unified an immense territory in his jihad against the superior but quarrelling Hausa states of the north, which was stabilised by his successors as the \"Caliphate of Sokoto\".\nIn its initial endeavour to stop the slave trade in West Africa, the United Kingdom gradually expanded its sphere of influence after 1851, starting from the tiny island of Lagos (3 km2) and the port city of Calabar. The British followed expansive trading companies such as the RNC and missionaries such as Mary Slessor, who advanced into the hinterland, preached and founded missionary schools, but also took action against local customs such as the religiously induced killing of twins or servants of deceased village elders and against the Trial by ordeal as a means of establishing the legal truth. At the Berlin Congo Conference in 1885, the European powers demarcated their spheres of interest in Africa without regard to ethnic or linguistic boundaries and without giving those affected a say. Thereafter, the British made increasing advances in the Niger region, which they had negotiated in Berlin, and ultimately defeated the Sokoto Caliphate. From 1903, Great Britain controlled almost the entire present-day territory of Nigeria, which was united under a single administration in 1914 (in 1919, a border strip of the former German colony of Cameroon was added to the territory of Nigeria).\nUnder the British colonial administration, purchasing cartels (of companies such as Unilever, Nestl√© and Cadbury) kept the prices of cocoa, palm oil and peanuts artificially low, thereby damaging Nigerian agriculture, but on the other hand ports and an extensive railway network were also built. Newspapers, political parties, trade unions and higher education institutions were established - rather against the wishes of the colonial rulers in order to control the oversized colony. In the East African campaign of 1941, Nigerian regiments achieved the first major success against the Axis powers with the fastest military advance in history at the time. In 1956, oil fields were discovered in Nigeria. Since then, vandalism, oil theft and illegal, unprofessional refining by local residents have caused the contamination of the Niger Delta with crude and heavy oil, particularly around disused exploratory boreholes.\nNigeria became independent in 1960. From 1967 to 1970, the \"Biafra War\" raged in the south-east - one of the worst humanitarian disasters of modern times. After three decades mostly of increasingly restrictive military dictatorships, Nigeria became a democratic federal republic based on the US model in 1999. Quadrennial elections are criticised as \"non-transparent\". Nevertheless, changes of power in the presidential villa at Aso Rock took place peacefully in 2007, 2010, 2015 and 2023, making Nigeria one of the few stable democracies in the region - despite its shortcomings. The Boko Haram revolt of 2014, which received much attention in the West, fell apart due to infighting and the united approach of Nigeria and its neighbours. The spread of the Ebola epidemic to the slums of Lagos in the same year was prevented by professional crisis management. Recent years have seen the rise of the Nigerian music and film industry and success in software programming with five out of seven African tech unicorns. With large new refineries, the country attempts since January 2024 to process the extracted domestic crude oil on its own and in a professional manner in the future (meaning without heavy oil as a waste product).\nThe biggest security problem is the numerous kidnappings, 38% of Nigerians personally know a kidnap victim. Due to the abrupt economic turnaround in 2023, 64% of Nigerians are hungry or cannot finance basic needs. 78% rate the work of President Tinubu as ‚Äòpoor‚Äô or ‚Äòvery poor‚Äô.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\nAcheulean tool-using archaic humans may have dwelled throughout West Africa since at least between 780,000 BP and 126,000 BP (Middle Pleistocene).\nBy at least 61,000 BP, Middle Stone Age West Africans may have begun to migrate south of the West Sudanian savanna, and, by at least 25,000 BP, may have begun to dwell near the coast of West Africa.\nAn excessively dry Ogolian period occurred, spanning from 20,000 BP to 12,000 BP. By 15,000 BP, the number of settlements made by Middle Stone Age West Africans decreased as there was an increase in humid conditions, expansion of the West African forest, and increase in the number of settlements made by Late Stone Age West African hunter-gatherers. Iwo Eleru people persisted at Iwo Eleru, in Nigeria, as late as 13,000 BP.\nMacrolith-using late Middle Stone Age peoples, who dwelled in Central Africa, to western Central Africa, to West Africa, were displaced by microlith-using Late Stone Age Africans as they migrated from Central Africa into West Africa. After having persisted as late as 1000 BP, or some period of time after 1500 AD, remaining West African hunter-gatherers were ultimately acculturated and admixed into the larger groups of West African agriculturalists.\nThe Dufuna canoe, a dugout canoe found in Yobe State in northeastern Nigeria has been dated to around 6300 BC, making it the oldest known boat in Africa, and the second oldest worldwide.\n\n\n== Iron Age ==\n\nArchaeological sites containing iron smelting furnaces and slag have been excavated at sites in the Nsukka region of southeast Nigeria in what is now Igboland: dating to 2000 BC at the site of Lejja (Eze-Uzomaka 2009) and to 750 BC and at the site of Opi (Holl 2009). Iron metallurgy may have been independently developed in the Nok culture between the 9th century BC and 550 BC. More recently, Bandama and Babalola (2023) have indicated that iron metallurgical development occurred 2631 BC ‚Äì 2458 BC at Lejja, in Nigeria.\nDaima, an archaeological tell site located near Lake Chad in Borno State, has a history of human occupation spanning approximately 1800 years, from 550 BC to 1150 AD. The sequence of occupation is divided into three phases: Daima I (800 BC‚Äî500 AD) represents an occupation of a people without metalwork; Daima II (500 BC‚Äî800 AD) represents the earliest iron-using people of the site; and Daima III (800 BC‚Äî1100/1300 AD) a more \"advanced\" iron-using people.\n\n\n=== Nok culture ===\n\nNok culture may have emerged in 1500 BC and continued to persist until 1 BC. Nok people developed terracotta sculptures through large-scale economic production, as part of a complex funerary culture.  Iron metallurgy may have been independently developed in the Nok culture between the 9th century BC and 550 BC. As each share cultural and artistic similarity with the Nok culture, the Niger-Congo-speaking Yoruba, Jukun, or Dakakari peoples may be descendants of the Nok peoples. Based on stylistic similarities with the Nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of the Yoruba Ife Empire and the Bini kingdom of Benin may also be continuations of the traditions of the earlier Nok culture.\n\n\n=== Igbo-Ukwu ===\n\nIgbo-Ukwu, an archaeological site in southeastern Nigeria, gained prominence for its remarkable discoveries dating back to the 9th century AD. The excavations revealed a complex of burial sites containing a stunning array of bronze and copper artifacts, showcasing advanced metalworking skills. Among the findings were intricately crafted ceremonial vessels, ornaments, and tools, challenging previous assumptions about the technological and artistic sophistication of ancient sub-Saharan Africa. The artifacts highlight a sophisticated society with a high level of craftsmanship and organizational complexity, providing crucial insights into the rich cultural traditions of the Igbo people.\nThe significance of Igbo-Ukwu lies in its contribution to reshaping the understanding of early African cultures. The site's discoveries not only demonstrated the Igbo people's ability to create aesthetically pleasing objects but also challenged misconceptions about the historical achievements of the continent. Igbo-Ukwu stands as a testament to the advanced metallurgical practices and cultural richness of the people who inhabited the region, leaving a lasting legacy in the study of African archaeology.\n\n\n== Roman expeditions to Nigeria (1st century AD) ==\nBetween 50 AD and 90 AD, Roman explorers undertook three expeditions to the area of present-day Nigeria. The reports of these expeditions confirm, among other things, the geologically already established extent of Lake Chad at that time and thus its drastic shrinkage in the past 2,000 years.\nThe expeditions were supported by legionaries and served mainly commercial purposes.\nOne of the main goals of the explorations was the search for and extraction of gold, which was to be transported back to the Roman provinces on the Mediterranean coast by land with the help of camels.\nThe Romans had at their disposal the memoirs of the ancient Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator. However, it is not known to what extent they were read, believed or found interesting by the Romans.\nThe three Roman explorations/expeditions in Nigeria were:\n\nThe Flaccus expedition\nThe Matiernus expedition\nPossibly a commander of Legio III Augusta named Festus undertook an expedition in the direction of the Niger River.\nRoman coins have been found in Nigeria. However, it is likely that all these coins were introduced at a much later date and there was not direct Roman traffic this far down the west coast. The coins are the only ancient European items found in Central Africa.\n\n\n== Early states before 1500 ==\n\n\n=== Advance of Islam in the north, the 14 Hausa states ===\n\nWith the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD, the area became known as Sudan or Bilad Al Sudan (‚ÄúLand of the Blacks‚Äù, Arabic: ÿ®ŸÑÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàÿØÿßŸÜ). Around the eighth century, Arab documents mention that Muslims crossed the Sahara to West Africa for trade purposes. Several factors contributed to the growth of the Muslim class in non-Muslim kingdoms. Islam facilitated long-distance trade by providing merchants with useful tools such as contract law, credit (e.g. mudaraba) and information networks. Muslim merchants also played an important role as advisors and scribes. They had the ability to use letter-based writing (instead of hieroglyphics), which was helpful in the administration of kingdoms. Arithmetic in a decimal system (Arabic numerals) was also introduced to West Africa through Islam.\nA system of Hausa city-states had existed in northern Nigeria since the 11th century. These city-states were mainly subject to tribute to large empires such as Kanem on Lake Chad. In the 14th century, all the ruling elites of Hausaland were Muslims, although the majority of the population did not convert until the eighteenth century.\n\nFrom 1400 onwards, Nigeria's first written documents with letters were produced in the north of the country. They were part of the Islamic missionary work and were written in Ajami - a script based on Arabic, but supplemented by special letters for local languages (Hausa, Fula, Yoruba). The Hausa also began to write history. In the Kano Chronicle, the history of the Hausa state is traced back to 999 AD.\n\n\n=== Northern kingdoms of the Sahel ===\n\nAfter the collapse of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464-1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the Middle Niger region and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali conquered Timbuktu in 1468 and Djenn√© in 1473 and built his regime on trade revenues and cooperation with Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Muhammad Ture (1493-1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques and brought Muslim scholars to Gao, including al-Maghili (d. 1504).\nThroughout the 16th century, much of northern Nigeria paid homage to the Songhai Empire in the west or the rival Borno Empire in the east.\n\n\n=== Kanem‚ÄìBornu Empire ===\n\nKanem became an empire in the Lake Chad Basin in the 13th century. The Mai (king) of Kanem and his court adopted Islam in the 11th century.:‚Ää72‚Äì73‚Ää  The first ruler of Kanem was Saif and his dynasty, the Sayfawa, ruled the empire for a millennium (800 AD to 1846 AD).:‚Ää74‚Ää  The first Muslim ruler of Kanem was Mai Umme Jilmi (r. 1085-1097), who died on his way to Mecca in Egypt. Due to the growing influence of Kanem in North Africa and the territorial expansion it achieved in the 12th and 13th centuries, the empire became very well known in the Islamic world of the time.:‚Ää75‚Ää\nThe civil war that shattered Kanem in the second half of the 14th century led to the independence of Bornu. The Sayfawa moved to Bornu. Mai Ali Ghaji (r. 1470-1508) established a large capital there called Birnin N'gazargamu. He carried out government reforms and ended the civil unrest. With a reinvigorated army, he extended Bornu's influence to the neighboring regions and demanded tribute from some Hausa states. He also re-established diplomatic and trade relations with North Africa. Ali's successors continued to rule Kanem and kept it as a province of Bornu until the 19th century.:‚Ää77‚Äì78‚Ää‚Ää\nThe most prosperous period in the history of the empire was the reign of Idris Alauma (1571-1603). His troops carried out far-reaching campaigns: in the north from southern Libya to northern Niger; in the east from eastern Chad to northern Cameroon; in the south he put down the rebellion of a Marghi prince and in the west he subdued Kano. He also carried out administrative reforms. He replaced customary law with Shari'a law and appointed qadis (judges). He built several mosques, which were constructed from baked bricks instead of reeds. He also undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca and financed the construction of a hostel for the Bornu pilgrims there.:‚Ää79‚Äì82‚Ää\nBorno's economy was dominated by the Trans-Sudanese slave trade and the desert trade in salt and livestock. The court and mosques of Borno retained a reputation as centers of Islamic culture and scholarship.\n\n\n=== Development and formation of Ife ===\n\nArchaeological evidence points to settlements in Ile-Ife dating back as early as the 10th to 6th century BCE. The city gradually transitioned into a more urban center around the 4th to 7th centuries CE. By the 8th century, a powerful city-state had formed, laying the foundation for the eventual rise of the Ife Empire (circa 1200-1420). Under figures like the Now defied figures such as Oduduwa, revered as the first divine king of the Yoruba, the Ife Empire grew. Ile-Ife, its capital, rose to prominence, its influence extending across a vast area of what is now southwestern Nigeria.\nThe period between 1200 and 1400 is often referred to as the \"golden age\" of Ile-Ife, marked by exceptional artistic production, economic prosperity, and urban development. The Ife Empire's strategic location facilitated its participation in extensive trade networks that spanned West Africa. Of note is the evidence of a thriving glass bead industry in Ile-Ife. Archaeological excavations have unearthed numerous glass beads, indicating local production and pointing to the existence of specialized knowledge and technology. These beads, particularly the dichroic beads known for their iridescent qualities, were highly sought-after trade items, found as far afield as the Sahel region, demonstrating the far-reaching commercial connections of the Ife Empire.\nThe wealth generated through trade fueled the remarkable urban development witnessed in Ile-Ife. Archaeological evidence points to a well-planned city with impressive infrastructure, including paved roads and sophisticated drainage systems, a distinctive feature of Ife urban planning was the use of potsherd pavements. These pavements, created using fragments of broken pottery. The Ife Empire declined around the 15th century.\n\n\n=== Oyo and Benin ===\n\nDuring the 15th century, Oyo and Benin surpassed Ife as political and economic powers, although Ife preserved its status as a religious center. Respect for the priestly functions of the ooni of Ife was a crucial factor in the evolution of Yoruba culture. The Ife model of government was adapted at Oyo, where a member of its ruling dynasty controlled several smaller city-states. A state council (the Oyo Mesi) named the Alaafin (king) and acted as a check on his authority. Their capital city was situated about 100 km north of present-day Oyo. Unlike the forest-bound Yoruba kingdoms, Oyo was in the savanna and drew its military strength from its cavalry forces, which established hegemony over the adjacent Nupe and the Borgu kingdoms and thereby developed trade routes farther to the north.\n\nThe Benin Empire (1440‚Äì1897; called Bini by locals) was a pre-colonial African state in what is now modern Nigeria. It should not be confused with the modern-day country called Benin, formerly called Dahomey.\nThe Igala are an ethnic group of Nigeria. Their homeland, the former Igala Kingdom, is an approximately triangular area of about 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) in the angle formed by the Benue and Niger rivers. The area was formerly the Igala Division of Kabba province and is now part of Kogi State. The capital is Idah in Kogi state. Igala people are majorly found in Kogi state. They can be found in Idah, Igalamela/Odolu, Ajaka, Ofu, Olamaboro, Dekina, Bassa, Ankpa, omala, Lokoja, Ibaji, Ajaokuta, Lokoja and kotonkarfe Local government all in Kogi state. Other states where Igalas can be found are Anambra, Delta and Benue states.\nThe royal stool of Olu of Warri was founded by an Igala prince.\n\n\n=== Yoruba ===\n\nHistorically, the Yoruba people have been the dominant group on the west bank of the Niger. Their nearest linguistic relatives are the Igala who live on the opposite side of the Niger's divergence from the Benue, and from whom they are believed to have split about 2,000 years ago. The Yoruba were organized in mostly patrilineal groups that occupied village communities and subsisted on agriculture. From approximately the 8th century, adjacent village compounds called il√© coalesced into numerous territorial city-states in which clan loyalties became subordinate to dynastic chieftains. Urbanisation was accompanied by high levels of artistic achievement, particularly in terracotta and ivory sculpture and in the sophisticated metal casting produced at Ife.\nThe Yoruba are especially known for the Oyo Empire that dominated the region. The Oyo Empire held supremacy over other Yoruba nations like the Egba Kingdom, Awori Kingdom, and the Egbado. In its prime, they also dominated the Kingdom of Dahomey (now located in the modern day Republic of Benin).\nThe Yoruba pay tribute to a pantheon composed of a Supreme Deity, Olorun and the Orisha. The Olorun is now called God in the Yoruba language. There are 400 deities called Orisha who perform various tasks. According to the Yoruba, Oduduwa is regarded as the ancestor of the Yoruba kings. According to one of the various myths about him, he founded Ife and dispatched his sons and daughters to establish similar kingdoms in other parts of what is today known as Yorubaland. The Yorubaland now consists of different tribes from different states which are located in the Southwestern part of the country, states like Lagos State, Oyo State, Ondo State, Osun State, Ekiti State and Ogun State, among others.\n\n\n=== Igbo Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Nri Kingdom ====\n\nThe Kingdom of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture and the oldest Kingdom in Nigeria. Nri and Aguleri, where the Igbo creation myth originates, are in the territory of the Umueri clan, who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure, Eri. Eri's origins are unclear, though he has been described as a \"sky being\" sent by Chukwu (God). He has been characterized as having first given societal order to the people of Anambra.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland may go back as far as the 9th century, and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, is believed to have settled in the region around 948 with other related Igbo cultures following in the 13th century. The first Eze Nri (King of Nri), √åfiku√°nim, followed directly after him. According to Igbo oral tradition, his reign started in 1043. At least one historian puts √åfiku√°nim's reign much later, around 1225.\n\nEach king traces his origin back to the founding ancestor, Eri. Each king is a ritual reproduction of Eri. The initiation rite of a new king shows that the ritual process of becoming Ezenri (Nri priest-king) follows closely the path traced by the hero in establishing the Nri kingdom.\nNri and Aguleri and part of the Umueri clan, a cluster of Igbo village groups which traces its origins to a sky being called Eri and significantly, includes (from the viewpoint of its Igbo members) the neighbouring kingdom of Igala.\nThe Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, a sort of theocratic state, that developed in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types. These included human (such as the birth of twins), animal (such as killing or eating of pythons), object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos. The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri's subjects. This meant that, while certain Igbo may have lived under different formal administrations, all followers of the Igbo religion had to abide by the rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth, the Eze Nri.\nWith the decline of Nri kingdom in the 15th to 17th centuries, several states once under their influence, became powerful economic oracular oligarchies and large commercial states that dominated Igboland. The neighboring Awka city-state rose in power as a result of their powerful Agbala oracle and metalworking expertise. The Onitsha Kingdom, which was originally inhabited by Igbos from east of the Niger, was founded in the 16th century by migrants from Anioma (Western Igboland). Later groups like the Igala traders from the hinterland settled in Onitsha in the 18th century. Kingdoms west of the River Niger like Aboh (Abo), which was significantly populated by Igbos among other tribes, dominated trade along the lower River Niger area from the 17th century until European explorations into the Niger delta. The Umunoha state in the Owerri area used the Igwe ka Ala oracle at their advantage. However, the Cross River Igbo state like the Aro had the greatest influence in Igboland and adjacent areas after the decline of Nri.\nThe Arochukwu kingdom emerged after the Aro-Ibibio Wars from 1630 to 1720, and went on to form the Aro Confederacy which economically dominated Eastern Nigerian hinterland. The source of the Aro Confederacy's economic dominance was based on the judicial oracle of Ibini Ukpabi (\"Long Juju\") and their military forces which included powerful allies such as Ohafia, Abam, Ezza, and other related neighboring states. The Abiriba and Aro are Brothers whose migration is traced to the Ekpa Kingdom, East of Cross River, their exact take of location was at Ekpa (Mkpa) east of the Cross River. They crossed the river to Urupkam (Usukpam) west of the Cross River and founded two settlements: Ena Uda and Ena Ofia in present-day Erai. Aro and Abiriba cooperated to become a powerful economic force.\nThe Igbo-Igala Wars were a series of conflicts between the Igbo people and the Igala people in pre-colonial Nigeria. The wars occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries and were primarily driven by territorial disputes, competition for resources, and political power struggles between the two ethnic groups. The Igbo and Igala engaged in military confrontations, with both sides vying for control over strategic territories. These wars were part of the complex dynamics and inter-ethnic relations that characterized the region during that historical period. The outcomes of specific battles and the overall impact of the Igbo-Igala Wars varied, and the conflicts eventually contributed to shaping the socio-political landscape of the region.\nIgbo gods were numerous, but their relationship to one another and human beings was essentially egalitarian, reflecting Igbo society as a whole. A number of oracles and local cults attracted devotees while the central deity, the earth mother and fertility figure Ala, was venerated at shrines throughout Igboland.\nThe Kingdom of Benin had influence on the western Igbo, who adopted many of the political structures familiar to the Yoruba-Benin region, but Asaba and its immediate neighbours, such as Ibusa, Ogwashi-Ukwu, Okpanam, Issele-Azagba and Issele-Ukwu, were much closer to the Kingdom of Nri. Ofega was the queen for the Onitsha Igbo.\n\n\n==== Akwa Akpa ====\n\nThe modern city of Calabar was founded in 1786 by Efik families who had left Creek Town, farther up the Calabar river, settling on the east bank in a position where they were able to dominate traffic with European vessels that anchored in the river, and soon becoming the most powerful in the region extending from now Calabar down to Bakassi in the East and Oron Nation in the West. Akwa Akpa (named Calabar by the Spanish) became a center of the Atlantic slave trade, where African slaves were sold in exchange for European manufactured goods. Igbo people formed the majority of enslaved Africans sold as slaves from Calabar, despite forming a minority among the ethnic groups in the region. From 1725 until 1750, roughly 17,000 enslaved Africans were sold from Calabar to European slave traders; from 1772 to 1775, the number soared to over 62,000.\nWith the suppression of the slave trade, palm oil and palm kernels became the main exports. The chiefs of Akwa Akpa placed themselves under British protection in 1884. From 1884 until 1906 Old Calabar was the headquarters of the Niger Coast Protectorate, after which Lagos became the main center.\nNow called Calabar, the city remained an important port shipping ivory, timber, beeswax, and palm produce until 1916, when the railway terminus was opened at Port Harcourt, 145 km to the west.\n\n\n== First contact with colonial powers, Nigeria as a \"slave coast\" ==\n\n\n=== Trade in ivory, gold and slaves ===\n\nThe first encounters between the inhabitants of the coast and Europeans, the Portuguese, took place around 1472. The Portuguese began to trade extensively, particularly with the kingdom of Benin. The Portuguese traded European products, especially weapons, for ivory and palm oil and increasingly for slaves. The manillas that the Portuguese used to pay their Nigerian suppliers were melted down again in the Kingdom of Benin to create the bronze artworks that adorned the royal palace as a sign of affluence.\nIn 1553, the first English expedition arrived in Benin. From then on, European merchant ships regularly anchored on the West African coast, albeit at a safe distance from the mainland due to the mosquitoes in the lagoons and the tropical diseases they spread. Locals came to these ships on barques and conducted their business. The Europeans named the coasts of West Africa after the products that were of interest to them there. The \"Ivory Coast\" still exists today. The western coast of Nigeria became the slave coast. In contrast to the Gold Coast further west (today's Ghana), the Europeans did not establish any fortified bases here until the middle of the 19th century.\nThe harbour of Calabar on the historic Bay of Biafra became one of the largest slave trading centres in West Africa. Other important slave harbours in Nigeria were located in Badagry, Lagos in the Bay of Benin and Bonny Island. Most of the enslaved people brought to these harbours were captured in raids and wars. The most \"prolific\" slave-trading kingdoms were the Edo Empire of Benin in the south, the Oyo Empire in the south-west and the Aro Confederacy in the south-east.\n\n\n=== Caliphate of Sokoto (1804 to 1903) ===\n\nIn the north, the incessant fighting between the Hausa city-states and the decline of the Bornu Empire led to the Fulani gaining a foothold in the region. Originally, the Fulani mainly travelled with cattle through the semi-desert region of Sahel in northern Sudan, avoiding trade and mixing with the Sudanese peoples. At the beginning of the 19th century, Usman dan Fodio led a successful jihad against the Hausa kingdoms and founded the centralised caliphate of Sokoto. The empire, with Arabic as its official language, grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent invading armies in all directions. The vast landlocked empire linked the east with western Sudan and penetrated the south, conquering parts of the Oyo kingdom and advancing into the Yoruba heartland of Ibadan. The territory controlled by the empire included much of what is now northern and central Nigeria. The Sultan sent emirs to establish suzerainty over the conquered territories and to promote Islamic civilisation; the emirs in turn grew richer and more powerful through trade and slavery.\nBy the 1890s, the largest slave population in the world, about two million, was concentrated in the Sokoto Caliphate. Slaves were used on a large scale, especially in agriculture. When the Sokoto Caliphate disintegrated into various European colonies in 1903, it was one of the largest pre-colonial African states.\n\n\n=== Expeditions along the Niger and in northern Nigeria ===\n\nAround 1829, Hugh Clapperton's expedition to Europe made it known that and where the Niger flows into the Atlantic. (He himself did not survive the journey, but died of malaria and dysentery. His documents were published by his servant Richard Lander). After this, there were numerous privately funded forays into the interior, such as the Niger Expedition of 1841 (in which a large number of the European participants quickly died of tropical diseases and which is reported in the diary of fellow traveller Samuel Ajayi Crowther, mentioned again in the next chapter).\nAround 1850, the explorer Heinrich Barth travelled through northern Nigeria as part of a British expedition. Through his travels, Barth acquired special merits in the unprejudiced and respectful study of peoples and languages (he himself had the ability to learn African languages very quickly - he spoke and wrote Arabic fluently), as well as in African history. Barth also developed the hypothesis of a primeval wet phase in northern Africa.\n\n\n=== British ban on the slave trade (from 1807) ===\n\nAround 1750, British merchant ships shipped European goods to Africa, from there slaves to American plantations and products from there, such as tobacco, to Europe. However, from 1787 and increasingly from 1791, following reports of a slave revolt in Saint Domingue, the British Parliament debated the abolition of the slave trade.\nWith the prohibition of the slave trade (not slavery) by Britain in 1807, British interest in Nigeria shifted to palm oil for use in soaps and as a lubricant for machinery. However, abolition in Britain was one-sided, and many other countries took its place. European companies and smugglers continued to operate the Atlantic slave trade. The British West Africa Squadron attempted to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally founded by Lieutenant John Clarkson for the resettlement of slaves freed by Britain after the American Revolutionary War in North America.\n\n\n== British colonial rule ==\n\n\n=== Crown Colony of Lagos (since 1861) ===\n\nBritain's West Africa squadron was tenacious in concluding anti-slavery treaties with coastal chiefdoms along the West African coast from Sierra Leone through the Niger Delta to the south of the Congo. However, the Nigerian coast proved difficult to control with its countless bays, meandering channels and rampant tropical diseases. Badagry, Lagos, Bonny and Calabar therefore remained lively centres of the slave trade. The fight against the slave trade by the British plunged the kingdom of Oyo into a crisis that ultimately led to civil war within the Yoruba region. It became a constant source of prisoners of war for the slave markets.\n\n\n==== The consulate era ====\nIn 1841, Oba Akitoye ascended the throne of Lagos and tried to put an end to the slave trade. Some Lagos merchants resisted the ban, deposed the king and replaced him with his brother Kosoko. Britain intervened in this power struggle within the Lagos royalty by bombarding Lagos with the Royal Navy in 1851. The British thus replaced Kosoko with Akitoye again. In 1852, Akitoye and the British consul John Beecroft signed a treaty to free the slaves and grant the British permanent trade access to Lagos. However, Akitoye had difficulties implementing these resolutions. The situation therefore remained unsatisfactory for Britain.\nThe Royal Navy originally used the harbour of the island of Fernando Po (now Bioko, Equatorial Guinea) off Nigeria as a base of operations. In 1855, Spain claimed this harbour for itself. The Royal Navy therefore had to look for another naval base and chose the island of Lagos, which at 9 km2 was roughly the same size as the Orkney island of Papa Westray resp. five times the size of Coney Island or one seventh of Lower Manhattan and flooded several times per year, for this purpose. King Akitoye had died in the meantime. His brother Kosoko then threatened to take back control of Lagos with the help of French colonial troops. The American Civil War, which centred on the issue of slavery, made the power struggle for Lagos particularly urgent. As a result, Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) made the decision that it was expedient \"losing no time in assuming the formal protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the acting consul in Lagos, together with Commander Bedingfield, convened a meeting with King Dosunmu, Akitoye's successor, on board HMS Prometheus on 30 July 1861, at which the British intentions were explained. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty, but under the threat of having Commander Bedingfield bombard Lagos, he relented and signed the Lagos Cession Treaty.\n\n\n==== Lagos, naval base and growing commercial centre ====\nLagos proved to be strategically useful and became a major trading centre as traders could count on the protection of the Royal Navy to protect them from pirates, for example. British missionaries penetrated further inland. Brazilian freedmen settled in Lagos.\nThe British government introduced English laws in Lagos in 1862. There was the Court of Civil and Criminal Justice and the West African Court of Appeal. A Supreme Court was established in 1876. English common law, equity law and British law applied.\n\n\n==== Push into the hinterland ====\nAfter its experiences in the American War of Independence, Great Britain had limited itself to maintaining strategically placed bases around the world - such as Lagos - and avoided colonising regions far from the coast. This changed in the 1860s, when European powers embarked on the \"Scramble for Africa\". Up until this point, European trade with the natives was conducted by ships that anchored off the coast and travelled on once the business was concluded. As tropical lagoons - unlike the open sea - offer favourable conditions for mosquitoes, which pass on tropical diseases, Europeans avoided going ashore. Because of the \"sleeping sickness\", West Africa was nicknamed \"The white man's grave\" until around 1850. The industrial production of quinine from the 1820s and its use as a prophylactic against malaria on a large scale changed the situation. The European naval powers were now able to establish permanent settlements in the tropics.\nBritish missionaries penetrated the interior of the country. In south-eastern Nigeria, Hope Wadell and Mary Slessor fought against the customary killing of newborn twins, against the trial by ordeal in legal disputes and against the killing of the servants of deceased village elders (in order to be able to serve them in the afterlife) from 1845 onwards. Missionaries founded schools and enabled the careers of Eyo Ita, the first dark-skinned professor, and Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first Nigerian president, for example. In 1864, Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the Anglican Church.\n\n\n=== The Royal Niger Company, the monopolist on the Niger ===\n\nThe first years of European colonialism in Africa were characterised by the Austrian school of economics and the marginal utility theory it advocated, according to which the value of products manufactured in Europe was higher in markets that were not yet saturated, such as Africa (marginal utility), and trade with colonies was therefore more profitable than in one's own country, for example. (The lower demand or purchasing power in the unsaturated market was not taken into account).\n\nWith the prospect of such high profits, various private trading companies promoted European influence in West Africa. One of them was the United Africa Company, founded by George Goldie in 1879, which was granted concessions for the entire area around the Niger Basin by the British government in 1886 under the name Royal Niger Company. The RNC marked out its territory as if it were a state in its own right and also negotiated treaties with the northern states, the Sokoto Caliphate, Nupe and Gwandu. It was also authorised to administer justice in its territories.\nThe RNC faced competition from three other groups, two French trading companies and another British group. A price war ensued, in which the RNC emerged victorious because in France the main proponent of African colonisation, L√©on Gambetta, had died in 1882 and in 1883 considerable subsidies for these \"colonisation companies\" were cancelled by the mother country.\nThe RNC's monopoly enabled Britain to resist French and German demands for the internationalisation of trade on the Niger during negotiations at the Berlin Conference in 1884‚Äì1885. Goldie succeeded in having the region in which the RNC operated included in the British sphere of interest. British assurances that free trade in Niger would be respected were hollow words: the RNC's more than 400 contracts with local leaders obliged the natives to trade exclusively with or through the company's agents. High tariffs and royalties drove competing companies out of the territory. When King Jaja of Opobo organised his own trading network and even began routing his own palm oil shipments to Britain, he was lured onto a British warship and exiled to St Vincent on charges of 'breach of treaty' and 'obstruction of trade'.\nThe RNC, which traded mainly in liquor and arms along the Niger, soon gained a bad reputation. Originally a way for the colonial office to bring the region under British control at little cost, it proved ineffective in promoting peace and stability. This was evident in the case of the Brass. They had no arable land of their own and traditionally lived from barter along the Niger. With the advent of the RCN, they had to pay license fees for imports and exports, which they could not afford. The Brass tried unsuccessfully to find alternative trade routes and began to starve. On December 29, 1894, they attacked the RNC headquarters in Akassa, looting much of the company's property and destroying the warehouses and machinery. They even kidnapped several of the company's employees, whom they later ritually ate as part of a spiritual ceremony, which they hoped would protect them against the rampant smallpox epidemic. The RNC now demanded massive protection for its employees from the Colonial Office, which the latter was not prepared to do and which contradicted the above-mentioned goal of low expenditure. The Colonial Office, which had been under the imperialist leadership of Joseph Chamberlain since 1895, increasingly wondered whether it would not be better to place the monopolist's territory under direct colonial rule.\n\n\n=== After the Berlin Congo Conference ===\nThe Berlin Congo Conference of 1885 defined the spheres of interest of the European colonial powers in Africa - without regard to ethnic or cultural conditions and without the participation of the people in the affected regions. For example, the territory of the Yoruba and that of the Hausa was divided by the demarcation between the British and the French. One must even assume that this was intentional. After all, this fragmentation naturally made it easier for the colonial rulers to dominate the indigenous people.\nAlthough this avoided wars between Europeans over these colonies, it encouraged military advances by Europeans in Africa - with devastating consequences for the \"natives\". This was due to the fact that a colonial power's demarcated territories were only valid if that colonial power actually brought the area under its control (rather than another power first).\n\n\n==== Conquest of Ijebu (1892) and Oyo (1895) ====\nThe United Kingdom now took military action wherever British traders or missionaries saw their fields of activity restricted. In 1892, the British conquered the Ijebu Empire on the outskirts of Lagos, an empire that had previously seceded from the Oyo Empire and refused to engage in trade with the British. Machine guns (of the Maxim type) were used for the first time. One Captain Lugard (see below) noted: \"On the West Coast, in the 'Jebu' war, undertaken by Government, I have been told 'several thousands' were mowed down by the Maxim.\"\nIn 1895, it was now not the British traders who called for military action, but missionaries in the Oyo Empire 50 km north of Lagos - which, even after its decline, was still one of the most powerful native states in present-day Nigeria and restricted the activities of the missionaries. The British bombed the capital Ibadan after Christian missionaries had brought their parishioners to safety. After the bombardment, the missionaries had a \"fair\" talk with the elector-king (Alaafin) of Ibadan and convinced him to submit to British protection. Anglican Christianity became the \"state religion\" in Oyo.\nThe conquered territory was administered as the British \"Protectorate of Yorubaland\", while Lagos remained a colony. Residents of a colony were direct subjects of the Crown and could, for example, initiate legal proceedings against the colonial rulers. Residents of a protectorate did not have these rights.\n\n\n==== The punitive expedition to the Kingdom of Benin in 1897 ====\n\nBenin was a slave-owning state 150 kilometres east of Lagos and was one of the four largest kingdoms in what is now Nigeria. As early as 1862, there were reports of human sacrifices being made in Benin in times of need. Consul Burton described the kingdom as \"gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death\".\nIn 1892, Great Britain concluded a contract with King (Oba) Ov·ªçnramw·∫πn of Benin for the supply of palm oil. The latter signed reluctantly and shortly afterwards made additional financial demands. In 1896, Vice-Consul Phillips travelled to Ov·ªçnramw·∫πn with 18 officials, 180 porters and 60 local workers to renegotiate the contract. He sent a delegate ahead with gifts to announce his visit - but the king sent word that he did not wish to receive the visit for the time being (King Ov·ªçnramw·∫πn was aware of the fate of King Jaja of Opobo (see above), which could explain his lack of hospitality). Phillips nevertheless set off, but was ambushed, from which only two of his fellow travellers escaped alive, albeit seriously injured.\nIn February 1897, a punitive expedition was set up under Admiral Rawson. The Colonial Office in London ruled: \"It is imperative that a most severe lesson be given the Kings, Chiefs, and JuJu men of all surrounding countries, that white men cannot be killed with impunity...\" 5,000 British soldiers and sailors invaded the Kingdom of Benin, which barely defended itself but made the above-mentioned human sacrifices in its misery. The British forces encountered shocking scenes.\nThe Kingdom of Benin was incorporated into the British dominion. The British burnt down the royal palace of Benin and looted the bronze sculptures there, which are now a World Heritage Site. These were later auctioned off in Europe to finance the punitive expedition.\n\n\n==== The West African Frontier Force ====\n\nIn 1897, Captain Lugard, who had already established and stabilised British colonial rule in Malawi and Uganda, was commissioned to set up an indigenous Nigerian force to protect British interests in the hinterland of the colony of Lagos and Nigeria against French attacks. In August 1897, Lugard organised the West African Frontier Force and commanded it until the end of December 1899. By September 1898, Britain and France had already settled their colonial disputes in the Fashoda Crisis and concluded the Entente cordiale in 1904, thus depriving the WAFF of its original purpose (However, the WAFF was to play a crucial role in the liberation of East Africa from (fascist) Italian rule during the Second World War in 1941. Colonel Lugard would significantly determine Nigeria's development over the next 22 years.\n\n\n==== First railway line ====\nThe first railway line in West and Central Africa - between Lagos and Abeokuta - was opened in Nigeria in 1898 (However, it was followed shortly afterwards by the British colony of Gold Coast/Ghana (1901), the German colonies of Cameroon (1901) and Togo (1905) and the French colonies of Dahomey (1906) and Ivory Coast (1907)). Forced labour was also (or mainly) used in the construction work. The staff of the railway company soon organised themselves and organised Nigeria's first strike in 1904.\n\n\n=== Southern Nigeria (since 1900) ===\n\n\n==== The Royal Niger Company sells its land ====\n\nTen years after the \"Scramble for Africa\" - in the 1890s - it became increasingly clear that colonial rule in Africa was not a profitable endeavour and that the exploration and development of the continent, which had originally been initiated by the private sector, could only be continued through state-military measures and/or taxpayers' money. The above-mentioned marginal utility theory had given way to the theory of \"shrinking markets\", a term coined by the economic theorist Werner Sombart. According to this theory, colonies were supposedly a necessary measure for industrialised countries to maintain sales and food supplies. The theory was adopted by both \"left-wing\" theorists such as Bukharin and Luxemburg (\"exploitation\" of the colonies) and \"right-wing\" thinkers such as Rosenberg and Hitler (\"Lebensraum\"). The RNC's concession was revoked in 1899, and on 1 January 1900 it ceded its territories to the British government for the sum of ¬£865,000. The ceded territory was merged with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, which had been under British control since 1884, to form the Southern Nigeria Protectorate, and the remaining RNC territory of around 1.3 million square kilometres became the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. 1,000 British soldiers were stationed in the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, 2,500 in the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and 700 in Lagos. The RNC was taken over by Lever Brothers in 1920 and became part of the Unilever Group in 1929. In 1939, the latter still controlled 80 per cent of Nigerian exports, mainly cocoa, palm oil and rubber.\n\n\n==== The south-east ====\n\nDue to the complex coastline in the Niger Delta, there were no closed dominions in south-east Nigeria until 1900, but rather a conglomerate of city-states that focussed on trade along the coast and inland along the Niger and Benue rivers. These city-states, which were united in the \"Aro Confederacy\", had a religious centre in Arochukwu, the \"Juju Oracle\". The form of decision-making in the city-states can be described as \"pre-democratic\". In this region, which later became sadly known as \"Biafra\", feudal rule was just as difficult to enforce as British colonial rule. (The later Biafra War of 1966 to 1970 was, among other things, a conflict between the democratic instincts of the south-eastern Igbo population and the authoritarian structures in the rest of Nigeria). The British defeated the Aro Confederacy in the Anglo-Aro War (1901‚Äì1902) and spread their influence along the coast to the south-east as far as German Cameroon. However, control of the Niger Delta remained an unsolved problem both for the British colonial rulers and later for independent Nigeria. Pirates, marauders, self-proclaimed freedom fighters and (since 1957) oil thieves still find enough nooks and crannies in the confusing landscape and under the jungle canopy to evade police action.\n\n\n==== After 1902 ====\n\nIn 1906, the crown colony of Lagos was incorporated into the protectorate of Southern Nigeria.\nIn Lekki, near Lagos, the Nigerian Bitumen Corporation under businessman John Simon Bergheim discovered crude oil during test drilling in 1908. However, engineers were unable to prevent large quantities of water from being extracted as well. Oil production could therefore not be made profitable without additional investment. Bergheim's fatal car accident in 1912 put an end to further exploration of Nigeria's oil reserves for the time being.\nIn 1909, coal deposits were discovered and extracted in the south-east of Nigeria, in Enugu Two years later, this region, the Nti Kingdom, was placed directly under British colonial administration.\nDespite the consecration of Samuel Ajayi Crowther as a bishop - or perhaps because of it - European and North American churches refused to accept dark-skinned clergymen, while the mainly Protestant missionary work in southern Nigeria was quite successful. This led to countless evangelistic and Pentecostal free churches, which are still omnipresent in the south today.\nNigeria's first trade union, the Nigeria Civil Service Union, was formed in 1912, but would not be recognised until 1938, until which time its members were subjected to harassment.\n\n\n=== Northern Nigeria (since 1900) ===\n\nIn 1900, Colonel Lugard was appointed High Commissioner of the newly created Protectorate of Northern Nigeria. He read the proclamation at Mount Patti in Lokoja that established the protectorate on 1 January 1900, but at this time the part of northern Nigeria that was actually under British control was still small.\n\n\n==== North-east ====\n\nIn 1893, Rabih az-Zubayr, a Sudanese warlord, conquered the Kingdom of Bornu. The British recognised Rabih as \"Sultan of Borno\" until the French killed Rabih at the Battle of Kouss√©ri on 22 April 1900. The colonial powers of Great Britain, France and Germany divided up his territory, with the British receiving what is now north-east Nigeria. They formally restituted the Borno Empire under British rule before the conquest in 1893 and appointed a scion of the ruling family of the time, Abubakar Garbai, as \"Shehu\" (Sheikh).\n\n\n==== Northwest ====\nIn 1902, the British advanced north-westwards into the Sokoto Caliphate. In 1903, victory at the Battle of Kano gave the British a logistical advantage in pacifying the heartland of the Sokoto Caliphate and parts of the former Borno Empire. On 13 March 1903, the last vizier of the caliphate surrendered. By 1906, resistance to British rule had ended, and there would be no more war within Nigeria's borders for the next 60 years. When Lugard resigned as commissioner in 1906, the entire region of present-day Nigeria was administered under British supervision.\n\n\n==== The Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, the ‚ÄòIndirect Rule‚Äô ====\nAfter the British trauma of the siege of Khartoum, the colonial office favoured a more subtle approach in Islamic northern Nigeria. Lugard developed the concept of ‚ÄòIndirect Rule‚Äô, in which the colonial rulers left the traditional social structures intact. The fact that the Sokoto Caliphate of 1804 was a rule of the Fulani over the more numerous Hausa worked in his favour. By replacing the Fulani with the British, the new British rule in northern Nigeria could be implemented with minimal social upheaval.\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was formally allowed to continue and a new caliph, Attahiru II, was appointed in 1903. However, the sultan of the caliphate was now the governor of northern Nigeria, namely Lugard. Like his Fulani predecessors, he had the right to enact laws and appoint officials. Murray Last therefore refers to the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria as the ‚ÄòColonial Caliphate‚Äô.\nThe local regents remained the emirs (several hundred in a three-tier hierarchy). The emirs were appointed by so-called ‚Äòkingmakers‚Äô, whereby the sultan / British governor had the right of nomination. The British governor could depose emirs and Lugard did this ten times in 1906 alone. (Even in the Fourth Republic of Nigeria, emirs are occasionally deposed by state governors).\nThe emirs carried out British instructions (such as drafting recruits during the world wars) and presided over a court that spoke Islamic Maliki law but, following the opinion of the orientalist Joseph Schacht, took British law into ‚Äòsupplementary‚Äô consideration. Within an emirate, the emir was therefore the employer of the judges (Alkali / Qadi) he appointed. Each emir was officially advised by a (British) ‚Äòresident‚Äô, but was actually controlled. The British prevented torture as a method of interrogation, the cutting off of body parts for theft and stoning to death for adultery, for example. As the Maliki school of Islamic law makes no distinction between, for example, murder and involuntary manslaughter or the (criminal) offence of vandalism and (civil) damage to property, the British introduced the principle of malice intent. Death sentences had to be authorised by the Resident and children of slaves were now considered freeborn.\nThe emirs also collected taxes. Taxes such as the land tax kharaj and the poll tax jizyah no longer went to the emirs. Instead, each emir could retain 25 per cent of the taxes he collected for his ‚Äòadministration.‚Äô The emirs thus had a financial and disciplinary motivation to be loyal to the British. Over the next few decades, Islamic law in northern Nigeria was continually restricted and by the 1940s only applied to family and inheritance law.\n\n\n=== Unification into \"Crown Colony and Protectorate\" 1914, Governor Lugard ===\nIn 1912, after an interlude in Hong Kong, Lugard returned as governor of the two Nigerian protectorates. He merged the two colonies into one.\nIn the same year, Lugard, who found the inhabitants of Lagos rebellious, had a new seaport built in the south-east as a rival to Lagos and named it Port Harcourt after his superior in the Colonial Office. This seaport soon received a railway line to Enugu and shipped the coal mined there (from 1958 also crude oil) overseas.\n\n\n==== Unification and yet separation ====\nLugard became the first governor of All Nigeria. The unification of Nigeria helped to give Nigeria common telegraphs, railways, customs and excise duties, uniform time, a common currency and a common civil service. Lugard thus introduced what was needed for the infrastructure of a modern state. However, the north and south remained as two separate countries with separate administrations.\nIn the south, English was the official language and was taught in schools, in the north Hausa. Southern Nigerians thus had access to English-language literature - from scientific literature to novels; their compatriots in the north had to make do with the much less comprehensive Hausa literature, which mainly dealt with philosophical and practical questions about Islam. (This imbalance can still be found today. In 2024, for example, there are 6.8 million articles in English and 101 articles in Hausa on Wikipedia.) Southern Nigerians also began to engage in literary endeavours. Since 1950, there has been an independent and dynamic Nigerian literary scene, in which the German-Jewish professor at the University of Ibadan Ulli Beier played a major role.\nThe protectorate in the south financed itself with ¬£1,933,235 in tax revenue (1912). The larger but underdeveloped Northern Protectorate collected ¬£274,989 in the same year and had to be subsidised by the British to the tune of ¬£250,000 annually. (This economic structure basically exists to this day.)\nRegional differences in access to modern education soon became pronounced. Some children of the southern elite went to Britain for higher education. The imbalance between North and South was also reflected in Nigeria's political life. For example, slavery was not banned in northern Nigeria until 1936, while it was abolished in other parts of Nigeria around 1885. Northern Nigeria still had between 1 million and 2.5 million slaves around 1900.\nThe attempt to enforce this system in the south also met with varying degrees of success. In the Yoruba region of the south-west, the British were able to tie in with existing or formerly existing kingdoms and their borders. However, as there were no hierarchical or even feudal structures in the south-east through which the British could indirectly rule, they appointed \"Warrant Chiefs\" with powers to act as local representatives of the British administration among their people. However, the British did not realise that in some parts of Africa the concept of \"chiefs\" or \"kings\" was not known. Among the Igbo, for example, decisions were made through lengthy debates and general consensus. The new powers vested in the Warrant Chiefs and reinforced by the native court system led to an exercise of power and authority unprecedented in pre-colonial times. The Warrant Chiefs also used their power to amass wealth at the expense of their subjects. The Warrant Chiefs were corrupt, arrogant and accordingly hated.\nGovernors were authorised to enact laws, otherwise English law applied. There was a Supreme Court, provincial courts and cantonal courts. Decisions of the Supreme Court could be appealed to the West African Court of Appeal. The provincial courts did not allow legal representation by lawyers and were staffed by administrative rather than judicial personnel.\n\n\n==== Racial approaches in the army ====\nFrom the outset, British colonial rule utilised - and reinforced - the differences between the ethnic groups present in order to offer itself to each side as a power-preserving factor and to be able to control the oversized colony with relatively little military expenditure (4,200 British soldiers). In the south, education, economy and civilisational achievements dominated, while in the north the military, feudalism and Islamic traditions were deliberately reinforced by the British. While officer positions were filled with British, enlisted men, non-commissioned officers and higher non-commissioned officer positions (sergeant majors) were exclusively filled with northern Nigerians, as these were regarded as \"warrior peoples\" in accordance with a popular doctrine practised in India since 1857 (e.g. Sikhs, Brahmins). Nigeria thus remained divided in many respects into the northern and southern protectorates and the colony of Lagos.\nOn Lugard, historian K. B. C. Onwubiko says: \"His system of Indirect Rule, his hostility towards educated Nigerians in the South, and his system of education for the North which aimed at training only the sons of the chiefs and emirs as clerks and interpreters show him as one of Britain's arch-imperialists\".\n\n\n==== First World War ====\nIn August 1914, a British-Nigerian military unit attacked Cameroon. After 18 months, the German Imperial Schutztruppe surrendered to a superior force of British, Nigerians, Belgians and French. Some German units were able to escape to the Spanish and thus neutral Rio Muni (today's Equatorial Guinea).\n\n\n=== Time between the world wars ===\nIn the Treaty of Versailles, the German colony of Cameroon was divided up between the British and French as a League of Nations trust territory. In 1920, the western part of the former German colony of Cameroon was administratively annexed to British Nigeria as a League of Nations mandate territory under the name British Cameroons.\n\nLugard's successor (1919‚Äì1925), Sir Hugh Clifford, was an avowed opponent of Lugard's views and saw his role not in the efficient running of an apparatus of power, but in the development of the country. He intensified educational efforts in the south and repeatedly suggested to the Colonial Office in London that the power of the absolutist emirs ruling in the north should be limited - which was rejected. This further deepened the de facto division of the country into a northern, south-western and south-eastern part. In the north, the indirect rule aimed at preserving feudal rule continued to apply. In the south, an educated elite based on the European model emerged.\nIn 1922, Clifford established the Legislative Council. The four elected members were from Lagos (3) and Calabar (1). The Legislative Council enacted laws for the colony and the protectorate of Southern Nigeria. It also approved the annual budget for the entire country. The four elected members were the first Africans to be elected to a parliamentary body in British West Africa. The Clifford Constitution accordingly led to the formation of political parties in Nigeria. Herbert Macaulay, a newspaper owner and grandson of Samuel Ajayi Crowther (see above), founded the first Nigerian political party - the Nigeria National Democratic Party - in 1923. It remained the strongest party in the elections until 1939.\n\nNigeria's (and the Commonwealth's) contact with Great Britain was mainly maintained by mail ships of the Elder Dempster Lines. Until the end of 1967, such a mail ship sailed from Liverpool to Lagos every second Friday, alternating between the MS Apapa, the MS Accra and the MV Aureol. The journey took 13 days and went via Las Palmas, Bathurst (Banjul), Freetown, Monrovia and Tema with a five-day stopover in Lagos-Apapa. In addition to letters, parcels and newspapers, the mail ships also carried cargo and about 250 1st class passengers and 24 3rd class passengers, which was mainly used by nuns and Salvation Army officers (there was no 2nd class). The 1st class, which consisted of colonial officials, colonial army officers, business travelers and globetrotters, had its own lounge, library, bar and smoking room. There were generous baggage allowances, which Nigerian traders were happy to fully utilize on the return journey to Lagos.\n\nThe railway company paid very well due to the activities of the well-organised railway workers' union, but also due to competing employers - who were happy to poach skilled workers. High school graduates could train as train drivers or technicians (\"engineers\") in six-year vocational school courses run by Nigerian Railways. During this training, the \"apprentices\" were paid and received an annual salary of ¬£380 - ¬£480 (as of 1935, in today's money value about ¬£38 - 48,000, significantly more than the average Nigerian income today). For the vocational students in Lagos, the railway company had specially provided a discarded but still functional 0-6-0 steam locomotive worth ¬£4 million (in today's money value), which they could use to learn how it worked.\nIn the meantime, it had become clear that colonies were neither \"profitable\" in the sense of the marginal utility theory described above, nor were they the solution to the problem of shrinking markets. Instead, Nigeria continued to gobble up taxpayers' money despite investments totalling several billions (like most African colonies) and hardly benefited the economy of the mother country. The new governor Graeme Thomson therefore introduced harsh austerity measures in 1925, including massive redundancies and the introduction of direct taxation.\nThe planned tax on women market traders, Graeme Thomson's undiplomatic manner and the unpopular Warrant Chief system (see above) led to the \"Women's War\" of 1929 among the Igbo. The women farmers destroyed ten native courts by December 1929, when the troops restored order in the region. In addition, the houses of chiefs and employees of the native courts were attacked, European factories looted, prisons attacked, and prisoners released. The women demanded the removal of the Warrant Chiefs and their replacement by native clan chiefs appointed by the people and not by the British. 55 women were killed by the colonial troops. Nevertheless, the Women's War of 1929 led to fundamental reforms in the British colonial administration. The British abolished the system of \"Warrant Chiefs\" and reviewed the nature of colonial rule over the natives of Nigeria. Several colonial administrators condemned the prevailing administrative system and agreed to the call for urgent reforms based on the indigenous system. In place of the old Warrant Chief system, tribunals were introduced that took into account the indigenous system of government that had prevailed before colonial rule.\nIn 1933, the Lagos Youth Movement - later the Nigerian Youth Movement - was founded and took a more strident stance in favour of independence than the NNDP. In 1938, the NYM called for Nigeria to be granted British Dominion status, putting it on a par with Australia or Canada. In 1937, it was joined by Nnamdi Azikiwe, who had been exiled from Ghana/Gold Coast for seditious activities and who became publisher and editor-in-chief of the West African Pilot and father of Nigerian popular journalism. In 1938, the NYM protested against the cocoa cartel, which kept the purchase prices from farmers artificially low. In 1939, the NYM became the strongest party in the elections in Lagos and Calabar (no elections were held elsewhere).\nIn 1934, the Warrant Chiefs were abolished.\nIn 1935, the railway network reached its maximum expansion after the last investment projects were completed. It comprised 2,851 km of track with a gauge of 106.7 cm (\"Cape gauge\") and 214 km with a gauge of 76.2 cm. This made the Nigerian railway network the longest and most complex in West and Central Africa. In 1916, a 550 m long railway bridge over the Niger River and in 1934 a bridge over the Benue River connected the regional railway networks. 179 mainline and 54 shunting locomotives were in use in 1934. Two maintenance and repair workshops in Lagos and Enugu employed about 2,000 locals. Rail transport was efficiently synchronised with maritime traffic. Travellers from mail steamers could board the \"Boat Express\" waiting right next to it at the port of Apapa in Lagos and reach Kano in the far north of Nigeria within 43 hours in sleeping and dining cars.\nIn 1931, the influential Nigerian Union of Teachers was founded under its president O. R. Kuti (the father of Fela Kuti). Nigeria's first industrial union, the railway workers' union, was also founded in 1931 by lathe operator Michael Imoudu. In 1939, trade unions were permitted by decree by the colonial administration, but Imoudu was arrested in 1943. The railway workers' union was considered the most militant workers' union in Nigeria. Imoudu remained under house arrest until 1945.\nGovernor Cameron standardised the administration of the Northern and Southern Provinces in the 1930s by introducing a native appellate court system, High Courts and Magistrate Courts.\nBernard Bourdillon became governor of Nigeria in 1935 and remained so for eight years. He maintained close contact with local politicians, especially the NYM. Bourdillon, who always opposed any form of racism, was presumably the only governor in Nigeria who saw himself as a representative of the country's interests - especially against prevailing views in the mother country. In the Colonial Office, he succeeded in 1938 in ensuring that the purchasing cartel for West African products such as cocoa, palm oil and peanuts was no longer supported by the British government. (The cartel included companies such as Unilever, Nestl√©, Cadbury, Fry's, Swiss African Trading Co, CFAO/Verminck, Union Trading Co/Basler Mission, G.B. Ollivant, Soci√©t√© commerciale de l'Ouest africain (SCOA), PZ Cussons/Zochonis, and others.) He involved the backward north more closely in political processes by creating a \"Central Council\".\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\n\n==== Sinking of both mail ships to Nigeria ====\nOn 26 July 1940, one of the two mail ships connecting Nigeria with the colonial power, the MS Accra, was sunk off Ireland by the U-34 submarine. 24 people died.\nOn 15 November 1940, the sister ship on the same route, the MS Apapa, was sunk by a German FW 200 Condor on its way home off Ireland. 26 people lost their lives. An identical ship was given the same name and took over the same route service (see picture above).\n\n\n==== Operation Postmaster ====\nIn 1942, Nigeria played a role in \"Operation Postmaster\". In an adventurous manner, British special agents from Lagos captured Italian and German supply ships for submarines in the South Atlantic on the nearby but Spanish and therefore neutral island of Bioko and brought them to the home port of Lagos. The incident - in which no shots were fired - almost led to Franco's Spain entering the war alongside the Third Reich and fascist Italy.\n\n\n==== Rationing, price control, agricultural damage, education offensive ====\nAs early as 1939, the Nigeria Supply Board was set up to promote the production of rubber and palm oil, which were considered important for the war effort, at the expense of food production. The import of agricultural products was restricted.\nFrom 1942, farmers were only allowed to sell rice, maize, beans etc. to government agencies and at a very low price under the \"Pullen Scheme\" so that the British Isles, which were cut off from the continent, could be supplied with food at low cost. However, this price control motivated farmers to either not sell their products at all or to sell them on the black market. Others may have resorted to growing unregulated, i.e. inedible, produce. Nigeria's agriculture, which had already suffered from the European purchasing cartels (especially Unilever) and the Great Depression, was once again hampered in its development. In December 1942, consumer goods were rationed. (Rationing would last until 1948.) The transport of rice from Abeokuta to nearby Lagos was criminalised.\nAs a \"positive\" effect of the Second World War, the colonial administration trained war-critical skilled labour such as technicians, electricians, nurses, carpenters and clerks on a large scale during this period. New harbours and - for the first time - airports were built.\nFrom October 1941 to January 1945, the 44th British General Hospital was stationed in Abeokuta, not far from Lagos. Soldiers, airmen and sailors could recover from their injuries here. There was also the 46th British General Hospital in Kaduna in 1942 and 1943.\n\n\n==== Nigerian regiments, advance in Somaliland and Ethiopia ====\n\nThroughout the war, 45,000 Nigerian soldiers served in the British forces in Africa and South-East Asia. Nigerian regiments formed the majority of the British Army's 81st and 82nd West African Divisions. These divisions fought in Palestine, Morocco, Sicily and Burma. Nigerian soldiers also fought in India.\nThree battalions of the Nigeria Regiment fought in the Ethiopian campaign against fascist Italy. In Kenya, four brigades from the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division formed the 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade, which was attached to the 1st (African) Division. On 10 February 1941, this Nigerian Brigade began Operation Canvas with the Battle of the Juba. The Indian Ocean port of Kismayu was quickly captured by 14 February. It was realized that the Italians had no depth to their defence, so the 23rd Nigerian Brigade was ordered to rapidly advance 275 miles to the capital of Italian Somaliland, Mogadishu, which was achieved in just three days. By early March most of Italian Somaliland had been captured and on 1 March Winston Churchill sent the following via Generals Wavell and Cunningham.\n\n\"Hearty congratulations on the brilliant result of the campaign in Italian Somaliland. ... vigorous, daring, and highly successful operations ... conducted..., [by a] well-trained, well-organised army. ...convey this message to [the] troops.\" The advance continued through Ethiopia towards the ultimate objective, Addis Ababa. On 10 March 1941, the Brigade quickly advanced to Degehabur, about 160 km (100 mi) south of Jijiga, and captured the city days later without resistance, before it participated in the reoccupation of British Somaliland later in the year. On 26 March 1941, two motorised companies of the Nigeria Regiment advanced 930 km from Kenya to Daghabur within 10 days in Mussolini-controlled Ethiopia. On 26 March, the Nigeria Regiment captured Harar near Djibouti after an advance of 1,600 km in 32 days. At the time, this was the fastest military advance in world history. The advance also divided the fascist sphere of control in East Africa. In their hasty retreat, the Italian forces also left behind important ammunition and food depots. Addis Ababa was conquered by the Allies on 6 April. The Ethiopian campaign became the Allies' first major success against the Axis powers, not least due to the \"Blitzkrieg\" of the Nigeria regiment. With East Africa (1.9 million km2), Italy lost an area in a few days that was larger than today's Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic states combined (1.3 million km2).\n\n\n==== Ideas from India on independence ====\n\nFighting for the Allies were 600,000 volunteers from Africa, who had been promised equal brotherhood in arms with their Caucasian fellow soldiers. Nevertheless, they received less pay than their European or Asian counterparts. Corporal punishment (flogging) was also still a disciplinary punishment exclusively for black soldiers. In northern Nigeria, it is not necessarily possible to speak of \"voluntary\" recruits, as the local tribal chiefs were prescribed contingents of \"volunteers\" as part of the Indirect Rule. The absolutist rulers did not necessarily take into account the voluntary nature of the troops when providing them for service at the front. During the war, none of the commanding officers of the Nigerian Corps came from Nigeria. (The first Nigerian officers received their licences at the end of the war).\nThe Nigerian soldiers can hardly have been unaware of the contradiction between their reality and the propagated British interpretation of wanting to protect Africa from German and Italian colonisation. In addition, the Nigerian troops had been fighting alongside their Indian comrades for several years and there was already a strong and media-effective independence movement against British colonial rule in their homeland under Mahatma Gandhi. (India became independent just 22 months after the Second World War.) The exchange of ideas with the Indians striving for independence almost certainly contributed to the fact that Nigerian soldiers returned home from Burma in January 1946 with completely new ideas about an independent Nigeria, but with less patience.\nIn his victory speech, the commander of the troops in Burma, Sir William Slim, did not mention the Nigerian \"brothers in arms\" at all.\n\n\n=== Post-war period, the road to independence ===\nDuring the Second World War, the number of Nigerian trade union members had increased sixfold to 30,000. A general strike by railway workers for higher wages and for the release of imprisoned trade unionists such as Michael Imoudu (see above) made it clear in 1945 that the previous colonial administration had to be replaced by a new, national form of government. \nThe new governor of Nigeria, Richards, like Graeme Thomson and Bourdillon an ‚ÄòOxford man‚Äô, introduced a constitution in 1946 that turned the country into a federation consisting of three states with uninspiring names such as ‚ÄòNorthern/Western/Eastern Region‚Äô and their own parliaments, governments and constitutions (the East had one house of parliament, the West and North a bicameral system). These would establish a central government for customs matters, common foreign policy and defence.\nIn retrospect, the Richards Constitution must be viewed critically and it was also viewed critically by Nigerians at the time. Money was collected in a campaign to enable the three most respected compatriots (newspaper publisher Macaulay, trade union leader Imoudu and journalist Azikiwe) to travel to London to present their views (ultimately unsuccessfully) to the Attlee government there. The British government in faraway London was apparently of the opinion that it knew better what was good for Nigerians than Nigerians themselves. After all, the constitution was slightly modified in 1951 and 1954; the last version, finally adopted by and named after the colonial minister Oliver Lyttelton, the son of the 4th Baron Lyttleton and later himself 1st Viscount Chandos, was the constitution with which Nigeria would become independent in 1960. Although there had been two conferences on the subject (one in London, the other in Lagos), these only had an advisory function: the constitution of independent Nigeria of 1960 was not the result of a constituent assembly of Nigerians, but a creation of British colonial ministers and governors, among whom (both) English aristocrats and Oxford graduates were still predominant at the time - representatives of the British upper class.\nIn this federation of just three federal states, the political process naturally became more of a conflict than a co-operation. Accordingly, the dominant political parties were organised along ethnic lines:\n\nThe Northern Peoples Congress (NPC) represented the eponymous northern Nigerians, especially the Hausa, and was led by one of the highest nobles of the north, Ahmadu Bello,\nThe National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) represented the Igbo in the south-east after the death of Herbert Macaulay under the leadership of journalist Nnamdi Azikiwe, and\nThe Action Group (AG) represented the Yoruba in the south-west and had Obafemi Awolowo as party leader.\nIn 1952, the regional parliaments were elected; for the Northern State, this was the first free election in its history. As expected, all three parties won a majority in their respective states and ethnic groups, with Bello, Azikiwe and Awolowo becoming prime ministers of their respective states. The governments of the North, South-West and South-East each constitutionally sent three ministers to the central government in Lagos. Accordingly, state revenues were also distributed according to a population proportion determined in Nigeria's first census in 1953 (previously there had only been estimates). The precarious balance only lasted with the British as the \"tip of the scales\", but for the nascent nation of Nigeria, without the British, it was only a preliminary stage that would last until one of the three ethnic groups no longer felt sufficiently represented in the federation. The main candidate for this was northern Nigeria and during the Kano riots of May 1953 secession was a distinct possibility. Many Hausa and Fulani favoured a separate, Muslim-majority state over the planned all-Nigeria. This was also due to the jurisprudence in the north. In the 1950s, civil and criminal law was still administered in northern Nigeria by emirs (i.e. by hereditary nobility, not by trained lawyers) in accordance with Sharia law. For northern Nigerians, it was hardly acceptable that this legal system should in future be given a higher instance in the form of the Supreme Court, in which non-Muslims and academically trained experts without a noble title would also be represented.\nOn the other hand, the south of Nigeria had co-financed the \"poor\" north in every fiscal year since 1914 (this has not changed until 2023) and even the most ardent advocates of a northern state did not dare to make the necessary tax increases palatable to their supporters. The funding dilemma initially delayed further endeavours for such a separate northern state and ultimately prevented it.\n\n\n==== Discovery of oil in the south-east ====\nIn January 1956, the first oil field in Nigeria, the Olobiri Oilfield in the south-south of the country, was discovered.\nThe new Conservative government in the United Kingdom under Harold Macmillan had been advocating rapid decolonisation in the British Empire since 10 January 1957, following the debacle in the Suez Crisis and in view of the high costs of the loss-making colonial system. In just a few years, Great Britain granted independence to a good dozen African colonies. However, unlike nearby Ghana, for example, Nigeria had not fought for its independence; Nigerian sovereignty had virtually slipped out of Britain's faint hand, exhausted by the Second World War, and fallen into the lap of the unprepared colony. The Nigerian independence movement lacked both the unifying experience of a struggle for freedom and the confirmation of a joint success against the former colonial power.\nOn 30 August 1957, the former transport minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa became the first prime minister of Nigeria's (weak) central government.\n\n\n==== Late farewell to racial ideas ====\nFrom 1958 onwards, the Nigerian army no longer recruited men exclusively from the north, as before, but from all over the country. In the following years, this meant that officer candidates from the south predominantly occupied the numerous positions of the outgoing British officers, as they were generally highly educated. This clashed with the older officers and sergeant majors, who had been taught that their people (Hausa, Fulani, Kanuri) belonged to the \"warrior peoples.\" and that representatives of the southern ethnic groups Yoruba and Igbo were not entitled to the new positions. This conflict was to trigger the Biafra War in 1966.\n\nThe first all-Nigerian parliament was elected at the end of 1959. The parties, which saw themselves primarily as representatives of ethnic groups or regions, won according to their population strength. The Northern Peoples Congress won 148 of the 312 seats in the House of Representatives and formed a coalition with several minor parties to gain an absolute majority. In order to keep the \"Giant of Africa\" under control and partly because of racial ideology, the British colonial government treated the ethnic and social groups in the country very unequally for decades. In the north, absolutist-feudal systems, and until 1936 even slave-owning systems, had been supported financially and militarily, while in the south conditions had been created that at least did not appear too alien to the Europeans there. In addition, as in francophone countries, an upper class educated in the mother country had been brought up, which only looked down on other compatriots. In just a few years, this \"development split\" would undo all colonial investments and development efforts in the now independent Nigeria.\n\n\n=== End of British colonial rule ===\nOn October 1, 1960, Nigeria was granted independence by an act of the British Parliament and admitted to the United Nations.\nAt first glance, the balance sheet of British colonial rule in Nigeria appears quite positive. The British put an end to human sacrifice, slavery, cannibalism, trials by ordeal and the killing of newborn twins and servants of the deceased in their colony. Islamic courts were forbidden to use torture for finding out the truth or stoning and mutilation as punishment. For the first time, intent of malice was taken into account in court proceedings. British missionaries founded schools, hospitals and libraries. British colonial officials created an efficient administration, a postal and telegraph network, paved roads and built ports and an extensive rail network. The colonial administration forced the Nigerians into the unavoidable cash economy with poll taxes. Unlike other colonial powers, it allowed a free press, political parties, trade unions, retail trade associations and women's organizations. - The socio-political activist Deji Adeyanju therefore claimed in 2022 that Nigeria was better off under the colonial masters than under the new indigenous politicians. Like Adeyanju, some Nigerians today see the colonial era as a Belle √âpoque (beautiful era) in which righteous colonial officials administered the country, foreigners invested in Nigeria and money was still worth something.\nHowever, the achievements listed above came from an autocratic system of rule that ran counter to traditional British achievements such as parliamentarianism or the rule of law and would never be accepted in the mother country. - The British only dared to introduce democracy for the whole of Nigeria when they realized that they themselves would soon be leaving. The governor enacted laws and even a constitution in 1946 without the participation of an elected parliament, without responsible ministers and against the justified protest of the most respected Nigerians (such an absolutist form of rule had already been abolished in Great Britain in 1688 with the Glorious Revolution). The lowest court instance did not allow representation by lawyers - a circumstance that the British had already abolished in their own country in 1275 and which denied the simpler Nigerians legal recourse from the outset. For Nigerians who grew up colonially, it must have seemed that civilizational progress was only possible under autocratic rule. Later Nigerian dictators from Agulyi-Ironsi to Abacha learned from the British governors and imitated them.\nAfter 1960, however, Nigerians would have to experience that dictatorships of native officers who had acquired their education in the barracks of the British colonial army - unlike the autocratic administration by Oxford-educated British colonial civil servants with aristocratic pedigree - would not bring progress, but would lead to arbitrary rule, war and genocide.\nThe British-induced development gap between North and South, the British failure to exemplify democracy, the racial segregation practised by the British and the internal Nigerian racism reinforced by the British would in a few years undo all colonial investments and development efforts in the now independent Nigeria.\n\n\n== Independence, First Republic (1960/1963‚Äì1966) ==\n\nOn 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained full independence from the United Kingdom on the basis of a federal constitution, with three large states having a weak central government over them. NCNC Chairman Nnamdi Azikiwe replaced the colonial Governor-General James Wilson Robertson in November 1960 and Elizabeth II remained head of state for the time being.\nThe NPC and NCNC remained the governing parties, with the AG now in opposition. In this AG, the Yoruba party, there was a bitter power struggle between Obefemi Awolowo, who advocated a socialist course and sought to close ranks with the Soviet Union, and the conservative Prime Minister of the South-West, Samuel Ak√≠nt·ªçÃÅl√°, who wanted to improve co-operation with the Northern Party (NPC). This internal party dispute became so heated that the central government under Balewa had to impose a state of emergency on the south-west in May 1962. Ak√≠nt·ªçÃÅl√° eventually founded a new party, the NNDP, which would win the disputed 1964 elections in an electoral alliance with the NPC. From then on, Ak√≠nt·ªçÃÅl√° was seen in his region as a vicarious agent of the backward and feudal north, which would cost him his life in 1966.\n\nOn 1 June 1961, Nigeria received the \"North Cameroons\", a Muslim-dominated strip of land on the border with Cameroon, following a referendum. The predominantly Christian inhabitants of the South Cameroons (bordering Biafra) decided against the Muslim-dominated and unstable Nigeria and in favour of belonging to Christian-dominated Cameroon. Both \"Cameroons\" were previously under UN administration; the Bakassi peninsula remained disputed.\nNigeria received a new constitution in 1963. Nigeria became a republic. The British system of government was retained. Abubakar Tafawa Balewa remained Prime Minister and British Queen's Governor Nnamdi Azikiwe became president.\nIn 1964, a new House of Representatives was elected. The NPC and NNDP electoral alliance won 198 of the 312 seats The Yoruba and Igbo (who generated the lion's share of tax revenue) now sat in opposition, while the Hausa/Fulani dominated politics and the lower ranks of the army up to the sergeant major ranks. Their northern state was larger than would have been suggested by the border between the three main ethnic groups or between the predominant denominations of Islam and Christianity. The Northern Region therefore included not only Muslim Hausa and Fulbe (for whom it was politically in favour, but who made up barely more than a quarter of the population), but also considerable minorities of Christians, followers of natural religions, Yoruba, Igbo and other minorities such as the Tiv. When the politically and militarily dominant Northern Region, which was chronically short of funds, wanted to impose a special tax, the Jizya, on the predominantly Christian Tiv in the same year, riots broke out in the affected region. 4,000 people were killed. One had to wonder how many lives would be lost if, for example, the much more numerous Igbo were to rise up and it was not about a special tax, but about the lucrative oil business in Igboland.\nIn the south-west, the unrest worsened in 1965 because the election results had apparently been falsified or were the result of intimidation and the government had halved the state-guaranteed producer prices for cocoa immediately after the election. There was arson and looting. Dozens of political opponents were tracked down in places like Ekiti or Ijebu-Ode (both not far from Lagos), doused with petrol and set on fire (\"Operation Wetie\"). Thugs controlled the streets. By the end of 1965, the south-west was in a state of complete anarchy.\nOn 1 May 1965, Sir Christopher Welby-Everard, the Chief of the General Staff of Nigeria and the last British officer from colonial times, retired. He was succeeded by Johnson Agulyi-Ironsi, an experienced officer, former military attach√© in London and commander of the UN protection force in the Congo in 1964.\n\n\n== Dictatorship and War ==\n\n\n=== The January Coup, dictatorship Agulyi-Ironsi (1966) ===\n\nOn 15 January 1966, six majors led by Patrick C. Nzeogwu (an intelligence officer), including five Igbo. The officers had received their commission in the UK in 1959-61 with honours at Sandhurst and Aldershot and recognised, not without some justification, the mismanagement and anarchy of the country they were returning to. The conspirators assassinated, among others, Head of Government Balewa and the Prime Ministers of the North and West, Bello and Ak√≠nt·ªçÃÅl√°. That the coup plotters also murdered the wives, secretaries and drivers of their originally intended victims at the same time casts a telling light on the perpetrators. Three of the conspirators, Nzeogwu, Ifeajuna and Onwatuegwu, also found enough time in the hectic hours of their attempted coup to locate and kill their superiors, Colonel Shodeinde, Brigadier General Maimalari and Brigadier General Ademulegun respectively, suggesting private revenge. Non-commissioned officer Daramola Oyegoke, who protested against this, was also murdered. Among the conspirators was Don Okafor, who, as commander of the head of government's guard force, was personally responsible for his protection and was on ‚Äòfirst name terms‚Äô with him; his part in the murder of Balewa, whose body was left by the roadside, shows a particular perfidy. Among the 22 victims was only one Igbo.\nFollowing the violent death of Prime Minister Balewa, Parliamentary President Orizu, an Igbo, transferred government power to the army chief Agulyi-Ironsi, also an Igbo. With his first decree, he abolished the constitution and freedom of the press and dissolved parliament. Remaining ministers were forced to resign, and from then on, the head of state ruled by means of directives issued by his staff. Ironsi abolished the three federal states and made Nigeria a unitary state for the first time: a country in which all laws, all taxes etc. applied equally everywhere, without regional variations. Nigeria was to be forced to progress by directive, so to speak. This was inevitably viewed badly in the backward north. In addition, the military government was reluctant to take action against Igbo involved in the coup. Ironsi was Igbo himself and used the more highly educated Igbo in the north to implement the supposedly progressive decisions of the central government on the ground. For other ethnic groups, it must have seemed as if the Igbo wanted to take over the country.\n\n\n=== Another coup, dictatorship Gowon, Biafra (1966‚Äì1975) ===\n\nIt should be remembered that the previously murdered Ahmadu Bello was not only the Prime Minister of the northern state, but also a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and of the ‚Äòblack Napoleon‚Äô dan Fodio, as well as Sardauna (crown prince) of the Sokoto Caliphate, a dynastic and religious title. For Muslims in the north, the complete clarification and rigorous atonement of the highly outrageous act was absolutely non-negotiable. From their point of view, the monstrosity of Bello's murder authorised a hitherto unknown level of revenge and violence. Ironsi, however, did not distance himself from Bello's killers (some of whom were from his personal work environment) and allowed investigations into them to fizzle out. Ironsi's omission was to cost him dearly.\nOn 29 July 1966, soldiers staged a coup in Abeokuta in the south-west and captured Agulyi-Ironsi, who was visiting nearby Ibadan. When he refused to answer questions from lower-ranking officers about his role in Bello's murder, he was taken to a forest near Lalupon by Major Danjuma's subordinates and shot. Theophilus Danjuma's co-conspirators included Murtala Muhammed, Bukar Dimka, Shehu Yar'Adua, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha, a list of future dictators of Nigeria (and those who wanted to become such) - at that time still mostly 1st and 2nd class lieutenants. Pogroms against the Igbo broke out across the country, with sources claiming 30,000 victims, mostly children. In this situation, the coup plotters appointed Lieutenant Colonel Yakubu (\"Jack\") Gowon as the new military and state leader and reintroduced federalism. Gowon did not belong to any of the three predominant ethnic groups and was confronted with the task of keeping the three divergent parts of his country and ethnic groups together and putting an end to the pogroms. Under these circumstances, it seemed unlikely that Yakubu Gowon's rule would last comparatively long - nine years. However, one of the worst humanitarian disasters of modern times occurred during this period: the Biafra War.\nIn September 1966, the pogroms against the Igbo reached their peak. An estimated 1 million Igbo fled from all over the country to the south-east, where they believed they were safe.\n\nIn May 1967, the governor of the eastern region, Lieutenant Colonel Emeka Ojukwu, proclaimed it an independent state, the \"Republic of Biafra.\" Following this declaration of independence, the remaining Nigerian forces attacked Biafra at Garkem on 6 July 1967. Nigeria was ill-prepared for this situation due to the liquidation of leading officers during the previous coups. As a result, the Biafran forces were able to advance westwards to Benin City in August 1967. Biafra was besieged and cut off from trade without either side being able to make decisive military movements. It was not until December 1969 that Colonel Obasanjo advanced to Umuahia with 30,000 troops, splitting Biafra in two. This decided the war. The hostilities finally ended after 30 months in January 1970.\nThe Biafra region, which had already had to cope with an unprecedented wave of refugees, was no longer able to feed its inhabitants due to the trade blockade. Estimates of the number of deaths caused by hunger and acts of war during the civil war range from one to three million. Photographs of starving children in Biafra went around the world and characterised the image of post-colonial Africa.\nIn addition to acts of war and hunger, genocides against unarmed civilians claimed numerous victims. These include, for example, the massacre of Asaba. When Nigerian troops conquered the Igbo-majority town in the Midwest in October 1967, the citizens were ordered to attend an ordered celebration in the town's central square. The 4,000 unarmed civilians who were gullible enough to comply were separated by gender; the men were murdered on the spot in front of the women and children.\nJohn Martin, caterer on a mail steamer and British citizen, remembers terrible events in September 1967: \"Arriving in Lagos and before the ship could ‚Äòclear‚Äô, the army came on board and assembled all the Africans on board, passengers and crew in the Dining Saloon. They started to segregate them with an officer identifying nationality and Nigerian tribal affiliations ‚Äì even by cheek scarring. Our Master-at-Arms was recruited to help. The Master-at-Arms was a Nigerian who travelled between Lagos and Freetown and return, overseeing the deck passengers who we picked up along the coast from Freetown ‚Äì and those travelling back from Lagos. In effect he was the security officer ensuring these passengers had bonafide tickets and they didn‚Äôt stray into other passenger areas of the ship. (...) Despite the efforts of Captain Hutchinson insisting the crew were under his protection, claiming the authority of the British Flag, those identified as Igbo‚Äôs, the last being the Master-at-Arms himself, were taken off the ship under armed escort. The last we saw of them was being taken round back of the sheds. Gunfire was heard. Bodies were seen floating in the lagoon on an outgoing tide.\"\nEvents like these have never been processed. Leading officers of the Nigerian army during the civil war, such as Obasanjo, Babangida and Buhari, were even head of state, some even several times, and continue to be influential in Nigerian politics (as of 2024). Igbo remain second-class Nigerians to this day, possibly due to their high level of assimilation to Western culture and high educational qualifications.\nThe federal government was only able to defeat the insurgents in Biafra with great difficulty. The fact that they succeeded in the end was mainly due to the officers Murtala Muhammed and Olusegun Obasanjo, who themselves became dictators a few years later after Gowon's overthrow.\nGowon had increased the number of federal states in Nigeria to 12 in 1967. With this strategic move, he blocked the realistic opportunity for both the south-east and the north to establish their own state, won over the minorities (to which he himself belonged and which make up 30% of the Nigerian population) and, by skilfully drawing the borders of the federal states, deprived the Igbo of control over both the oil wells and the seaports. This fundamentally changed the federal character of Nigeria, but it remained federal.\nNigeria joined OPEC in 1971. It experienced a dynamic economic boom during the 1974 oil crisis, which mainly triggered inflation, and was confronted with declining demand and mass unemployment in 1975. During these years, the north also experienced the worst drought since 1914. Dictator Gowon's 1972 nationalisation decree closed many sectors of the Nigerian economy to all foreign investment and banned foreign participation beyond a minority stake in several other areas. This decree proved detrimental to investment in the Nigerian economy.\nOn 1 October 1974, in contradiction to earlier statements, Gowon declared that Nigeria was not ready for civilian rule until 1976, and he postponed the handover date indefinitely.\n\nUnder Gowon, perceived corruption increased, especially among military government officials. Although Gowon himself was never implicated in the corrupt practices, he was often accused of turning a blind eye to the activities of his associates and acquaintances. Newspapers reported on bribery and nepotism. Theft and embezzlement in hospitals and orphanages outraged the Nigerian public. Medicines imported by officials at full price, which had long expired, showed that those involved were also indifferent to human lives.\nIn addition, the formerly efficient administration became bloated and was overburdened even with simpler tasks. The mismanagement in Gowon's administration culminated in the infamous \"cement armada\" in the summer of 1975, when the port of Lagos was overcrowded with hundreds of ships trying to unload cement. Representatives of the Nigerian government had signed contracts with 68 different international suppliers to deliver a total of 20 million tonnes of cement to Lagos in one year, even though the port could only take one million tonnes of cargo per year. The poorly drafted cement contracts contained demurrage clauses that were very favourable to the suppliers, so that the bill would skyrocket as the ships waited in port to unload (or even as they waited in their home ports for permission to leave for Nigeria). The Nigerian government only realised the extent of its mistake when the port of Lagos became so congested that basic supplies could no longer be guaranteed. Their attempts to cancel the cement contracts and impose an emergency embargo on all incoming ships kept the country busy with litigation around the world for many years, including a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision.\nDue to the turmoil of the Second World War and Nigeria's looming independence, the infrastructure, e.g. the railway network, was no longer expanded and was no longer maintained after the outbreak of the Biafra War in 1966. Nigeria's railway system became increasingly dilapidated (this also applies to the railway networks of other West African countries after their independence). As a result, by the 1990s, Nigeria's railway system had deteriorated to the point where it was almost completely non-functional. Large sections of track were missing or unusable, locomotives and rolling stock were in an advanced state of disrepair, and the system could no longer provide reliable service. Expertise was lost, training institutions no longer received funding and ceased operations. (It was not until 2009 that Nigeria began to renovate and lay new tracks again for billions of euros with Chinese aid (see Nigerian Railway Corporation), but the country will still be operating barely more than the colonial line length in 2023).\nScandals and the obvious mismanagement caused dissatisfaction within the army. On 29 July 1975, when Gowon attended an OAU summit in Kampala, a group of officers led by Colonel Joe Nanven Garba announced his overthrow.\n\n\n=== Dictatorship Murtala Muhammed (1975‚Äì1976) ===\n\nOn 29 July 1975, General Yakubu Gowon was overthrown while attending the 12th summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Kampala, Uganda.\nMurtala Muhammed assumed power as the new military head of state. He was considered brilliant and bold, but also unpredictable and impetuous.\nMurtala Muhammed also took control of the two largest newspapers in the country - Daily Times and New Nigerian; all media in Nigeria were now under state control. He also took control of the remaining state universities.\nIn a short time, Murtala Muhammed's policies gained wide popular support and his determination made him a popular hero. However, his highly popular but impulsive style of governance and often televised speeches with the frequent addition of \"with immediate effect\" also earned him criticism among the country's top officials. His ad hoc declarations often left his officials unprepared, lacking details and lacking the financial resources to implement his ideas.\nShortly after taking power, Muhammed realised that state revenues were falling due to low oil production. Global demand for oil had collapsed, spare parts had become more expensive and labour costs had risen. As a result, the military government lacked the funds to fulfil the Nigerian development plan for 1975.\n\nMurtala Muhammed then carried out a dramatic downsizing of the bloated and inefficient civil service (\"Operation Deadwood\"). More than 10,000 government employees were dismissed without transitional benefits. Numerous civil servants were tried for corruption and a military governor was executed for gross abuse of office However, due to the drastic nature of the purge, accusations were made that personal scores were also settled in the process of streamlining the civil service.\nOn 13 February 1976, Muhammed was driving to work in his unarmoured Mercedes-Benz 230.6, unaccompanied by bodyguards or the like. Shortly after 8 a.m., his car was driving slowly through the notorious Lagos traffic when a group of soldiers emerged from a neighbouring petrol station, ambushed the vehicle and murdered the unarmed Muhammed. This was part of an attempted coup d'√©tat by Lieutenant Colonel Dimka, who was executed on 15 May 1976 for treason. Muhammed's successor was the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Headquarters, Olusegun Obasanjo, who had escaped assassination through a case of mistaken identity. The Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos is named after the still popular military ruler, who is also (inaccurately) referred to as the \"Nigerian Kennedy\".\n\n\n=== Dictatorship Obasanjo (1976‚Äì1979) ===\n\nOlusegun Obasanjo formed a triumvirate with two other generals and increased general repression. The most famous example is probably the raid on the home of musician Fela Kuti, during which female family members were raped and his mother was thrown out of a window, suffering fatal injuries. Trade union activities were restricted. Dimka and 37 of his comrades-in-arms were executed.\nObasanjo swiftly convened a committee to draft a new constitution, modelling it on the US system. Even before a result was achieved, Obasanjo increased the number of federal states to 19. The draft of the new constitution was very similar to today's Nigerian constitution and summarised the position of the head of state and the head of government. The powerful position of the president was balanced by two chambers. The constitution was promulgated in September 1978. The five parties that ran their own presidential candidates in the 1979 election showed less vision than the above committee and focussed - as in the First Republic, but against Obasanjo's express wishes - primarily on representing ethnic groups. Despite the past 20 years and a survived civil war, the new party landscape was to a certain extent a copy of the old one:\n\nThe NPN represented the Northern Nigerians and thus took over the legacy of the NPC,\nthe NPP represented the South-East (like the NCNC mentioned above, again with Chairman Azikiwe) and\nthe UPN represented the South West (like the AG mentioned above, again with Chairman Awolowo).\nAccordingly, each party won by over 80 per cent in the state where it represented the majority of the population. The ethnic group that had the largest share of Nigeria's population - still Northern Nigerians - won the election with its party and provided the new president, Alhaji Shehu Shagari. So before it had begun, the Second Republic was already suffering from the same problem as the First Republic: a party landscape that had been formed along ethnic lines rather than ideological or programmatic standpoints.\n\n\n== The Second Republic (1979‚Äì1983), President Shagari ==\n\nOn 1 October 1979, Shehu Shagari was sworn in as the first President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As his party, the NPN, had barely more than 35% of the seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Shagari formed a coalition with the NPP, which had become the third strongest party in the parliamentary elections. This coalition had a slim majority in both chambers.\nShagari relied on large-scale industry and, in agriculture, on the \"Green Revolution\" that corresponded to the current state of science at the time: preference for large farms, intensive use of fertilisers and pesticides, use of machinery, drilling of deep groundwater, etc. The Green Revolution is viewed rather critically today (2023).\n\n\n=== Laying of the foundation stone for the Ajaokuta steelworks ===\nIn 1980, Shagari laid the foundation stone for the Ajaokuta steelworks, which was to be built by a Soviet state-owned company near the Niger River and the Itakpe ore mine. By 1991, 98% of the steelworks, which was to be built to Soviet standards, i.e. on a very large scale, had been constructed. However, by 1991 the Soviet Union had dissolved, world demand for steel had changed unfavourably and technology had developed further. The steelworks was not completed and had still not started operations in 1994 - which, according to Russian Wikipedia articles on the subject, was entirely due to Nigeria. Ajaokuta was seen as a prime example of failed development aid in West Africa. However, by 2017, 40 of the 43 plants were gradually able to start operations. In 2023, Ajaokuta Steel produced around one sixth of the amount of steel produced by the UK. Three other Shagari-era steel plants in Jos, Oshogbo and Katsina appear to no longer be active.\n\n\n=== Construction of social housing ===\nShagari began the construction of 200,000 social housing units across the country, of which 25,000 were completed during his term of office. A 2017 study by Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Awka criticised the lack of planning (the completed flats were not connected to water, electricity, sewerage or transport or were located in an area with no demand for new flats). The new flats were often never occupied, were not managed and soon fell into disrepair. Shagari's successors did not pursue the completion of the remaining flats, which also fell into disrepair.\n\n\n=== Deportation of West African immigrants ===\nIn January 1983, Shagari decided to deport West African immigrants under the slogan \"Ghana must go!\" in the face of an economic slump. An estimated 2 million Ghanaians had to leave the country suddenly and with malice, leaving most of their belongings behind. Provisional bags and suitcases became the symbol of the forced exodus (they are still called \"Ghana bags\" today). It is not without a certain irony that social and economic development in Ghana after 1983 was to be much more favourable than in Nigeria and that Nigerians, for their part, would look for work and income in Ghana.\n\n\n=== Economic isolationism ===\nShagari reacted to falling oil prices and the resulting economic downturn by restricting import licences and increasing customs duties. He rejected cooperation with the International Monetary Fund[165].\n\n\n=== Education, women's emancipation, environmental issues ===\nUnder Shagari, the education system in Nigeria improved. For example, a number of universities were founded. He also promoted the inclusion of women in political life. He filled many offices with women.\n\n\n=== Re-election ===\nSimilar to the First Republic, the Northern Party won an absolute majority in parliament after a few years in government and no longer needed coalition partners.\n\n\n=== Shagari's fight against corruption, General Buhari ===\nAlthough Shehu Shagari is cleared of personal involvement in corrupt practices, the Second Republic was plagued by allegations of corruption, including allegations of electoral fraud in the 1983 elections. In his second term, Shagari made attempts to curb corruption through the new Ministry of National Guidance under Yusuf Maitama Sule, which was created solely for this purpose. A new programme called Ethical Revolution was introduced, one of whose initiatives was the famous \"war against indiscipline\" launched under General Muhammadu Buhari. The ministry was only in office for three months before a coup d'√©tat in 1983 made Buhari the sole ruler.\n\n\n== Buhari (1983‚Äì1985) and Babangida (1985‚Äì1992), two unequal dictators ==\nThe military coup on 31 December 1983 was coordinated by leading officers of the Nigerian military and led to the overthrow of the government and the installation of Major General Muhammadu Buhari as head of state. The inauguration of Muhammadu Buhari was generally seen as a positive development Buhari promised reforms, but his government performed little better than that of his predecessor. General Buhari was overthrown in 1985 by a military coup led by General Ibrahim Babangida. Buhari would be elected president 30 years later, in the Fourth Republic and now democratically purged.\nBabangida was more far-sighted than Nigeria's previous military leaders, loosening state control over the press and releasing a number of prisoners. However, he faced the same economic problems that Buhari had faced and the same discontent in the country.\nBabangida soon gained a reputation as a clever politician. He asked the Nigerian people whether their country should accept a financial aid package worth billions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When, as he had expected, the Nigerian people refused to accept the package, Babangida suspended talks with the IMF. He then offered Nigerians his own economic recovery programme - which included many of the harsh measures proposed by the IMF - and convinced Nigerians to accept it. As a result of this programme, Nigeria received loans from banks and gained economic credibility in Western countries.\n\nAccording to Forbes, shortly before the Second Gulf War, Babangida diverted twelve billion US dollars in unplanned income (\"oil windfall\") into his own pocket (the oil price jumped from 15 to US$41.15/barrel within weeks in 1990 and then plummeted to the old value). However, these funds could never be found. Nevertheless, the additional profit of US$12 billion calculated by Forbes could only have been realised if Nigeria had sold the entire annual production volume of 630 million barrels on the world market exactly on 27 September 1990 at the annual high price of US$41/barrel - 19 more than the officially stated annual average of US$22/barrel (630 million barrels √ó US$19/barrel = US$11.97 billion). This is unlikely given the sluggishness of the state oil company NNPC and the lack of ex post information for those involved. Babangida commented in 2022 on the above allegations that he and his associates were \"saints.\" This account should be evaluated as cautiously as Forbes' calculation.In December 1991, the centrally located Abuja became the capital.\nThe Babangida regime ensured the establishment of a state security apparatus; it survived two coup attempts. General Mamman Vatsa and Major Gideon Orkar were executed, and the critical journalist Dele Giwa was murdered. In 1989, Babangida promised the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic. Babangida survived the 1990 coup attempt and postponed the promised return to democracy until 1992.\nBabangida's intelligence cannot be denied and his foreign and economic policies benefited Nigeria. The security apparatus and secret service he set up may be understandable in view of the fate of military ruler Murtala Mohammed - who was shot unarmed and without bodyguards in an unarmoured limousine in 1976 - but it went beyond the vital protection of the president and did not shy away from political murder. Babangida thus created the instruments with which his successor Abacha led Nigeria into its darkest epoch after the civil war.\n\n\n== The Abortive Third Republic ==\n\nHead of State Babangida promised to return the country to civilian rule by 1990 which was later extended until January 1993. In early 1989, a constituent assembly completed a constitution and in the spring of 1989 political activity was again permitted. In October 1989, the government established two parties, the National Republican Convention (NRC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP); other parties were not allowed to register.\nIn April 1990, mid-level officers attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the government and 69 accused plotters were executed after secret trials before military tribunals. In December 1990, the first stage of partisan elections was held at the local government level. Despite the low turnout, there was no violence and both parties demonstrated strength in all regions of the country, with the SDP winning control of a majority of local government councils.\nIn December 1991, state legislative elections were held and Babangida decreed that previously banned politicians could contest in primaries scheduled for August. These were cancelled due to fraud and subsequent primaries scheduled for September also were cancelled. All announced candidates were disqualified from standing for president once a new election format was selected. The presidential election was finally held on 12 June 1993, with the inauguration of the new president scheduled to take place 27 August 1993, the eighth anniversary of President Babangida's coming to power.\nIn the historic 12 June 1993 presidential elections, which most observers deemed to be Nigeria's fairest, early returns indicated that wealthy Yoruba businessman M. K. O. Abiola won a decisive victory. However, on 23 June, Babangida, using several pending lawsuits as a pretence, annulled the election, throwing Nigeria into turmoil. More than 100 were killed in riots before Babangida agreed to hand power to an interim government on 26 August 1993. He later attempted to renege on this decision, but without popular and military support, he was forced to hand over to Ernest Shonekan, a prominent nonpartisan businessman. Shonekan was to rule until elections scheduled for February 1994. Although he had led Babangida's Transitional Council since 1993, Shonekan was unable to reverse Nigeria's economic problems or to defuse lingering political tension.\n\n\n== Dictatorship Abacha (1993‚Äì1998) ==\nShonekan's transitional government, the shortest in the country's political history, was overthrown in 1993 by a coup d'√©tat led by General Sani Abacha. This was the seventh Nigerian coup d'√©tat in less than 30 years and also (as of 2023) the last military coup in the country.\n\n\n=== Absolute power, reign of terror ===\nUnlike previous military dictators in Nigeria such as Gowon, Murtala, Obasanjo or Buhari, Abacha can only be described as a reign of terror.\nAfter dissolving the government and parliament in November 1993, he also made himself chief justice in September 1994 and thus gained absolute power. Abacha put together a personal security force of 3,000 men trained in North Korea. Nigerian police forces were retrained on a large scale. The state ruthlessly cracked down on perceived political opponents.\nIn 1995, the writer and civil rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other defendants (the Ogoni Nine) were executed in Port Harcourt after a spectacular show trial that sparked violent international protests. Nigeria was expelled from the Commonwealth of Nations with immediate effect. The winner of the 1993 presidential election, Moshood Abiola, was arrested and died in unexplained circumstances, in any case due to lack of medical care after four years in prison. Former army chief of staff Shehu Musa Yar'Adua was also arrested - he also died in prison. Former military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo was also arrested for treason and accused of planning a coup d'√©tat together with General Oladipo Diya. The Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka was charged in absentia with high treason. Even the fatal plane crash of Sani Abacha's eldest son Ibrahim on 17 January 1996 and the subsequent assassinations of relatives of the 14 other accident victims were allegedly carried out on the dictator's orders; these rumours were strengthened by the fact that Abacha did not release the 15 bodies.\n\n\n=== Descent into a narco-state ===\nDuring his five years in office, Abacha's lack of co-operation in anti-narcotics operations led to the repeated revocation of US certification to combat drugs under Section 481 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA). This officially made Nigeria a narco-state. The US voted against Nigeria in six multilateral development banks and refused to provide any assistance to Nigeria under the FAA and the Arms Control Export Act. Direct flights from the US to Nigeria remained banned due to security concerns.\n\n\n=== Embezzlement of state funds, the \"Abacha loot\" ===\nUnder Abacha, the misappropriation of public funds reached epic proportions and is known as the \"Abacha loot.\" Abacha's National Security Adviser, Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo, submitted fake funding requests for national security, which Abacha approved. The funds were usually sent in cash or travellers cheques from the Central Bank of Nigeria to Gwarzo, who brought them to Abacha's house. An estimated $1.4 billion in cash was handed over in this way.\nIn a list of the ten most self-enriching heads of state, Abacha and his family rank fourth. They are alleged to have embezzled between 1 and 5 billion dollars.\nOn 7 August 2014, the US Department of Justice announced that $480 million had been seized from the Nigerian government, the largest amount in the country's history. Jersey's Civil Asset Recovery Fund discovered more than $267 million in funds allegedly laundered through the US banking system and deposited into an account in Jersey (¬£210 million). The US Department of Justice, the Jersey courts and the Nigerian government made a civil forfeiture of the funds, which will be divided between these countries.\n\n\n=== End of petrol production for 28 years ===\nDue to poor maintenance, incompetent management and the exodus of skilled labour, the last of Nigeria's four (state-owned) oil refineries ended its production of petrol in 1996. By September 2024 (when the privately owned Dangote refinery began operations), the country had to import 100% of its refined fuels in exchange for hard currency despite its vast oil reserves, not counting the production of a few thousand very small and extremely dirty illegal refineries in the Niger Delta.\n\n\n== Democratisation and federalism in 1998 ==\nAbacha died of heart failure on 8 June 1998 and was replaced by General Abdulsalami Abubakar. The military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) under Abubakar commuted the sentences of those accused in the alleged coup during the Abacha regime and released almost all known civilian political detainees. Pending the promulgation of the constitution written in 1995, the government observed some provisions of the 1979 and 1989 constitutions. Neither Abacha nor Abubakar lifted the decree suspending the 1979 constitution, and the 1989 constitution was not implemented. The judiciary system continued to be hampered by corruption and lack of resources after Abacha's death. In an attempt to alleviate such problems Abubakar's government implemented a civil service pay raise and other reforms.\nIn August 1998, Abubakar appointed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct elections for local government councils, state legislatures and governors, the national assembly, and president. The NEC successfully held elections on 5 December 1998, 9 January 1999, 20 February, and 27 February 1999, respectively. For local elections, nine parties were granted provisional registration with three fulfilling the requirements to contest the following elections. These parties were the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the All People's Party (APP), and the predominantly Yoruba Alliance for Democracy (AD). The former military head of state Olusegun Obasanjo, freed from prison by Abubakar, ran as a civilian candidate and won the presidential election. The PRC promulgated a new constitution based largely on the suspended 1979 constitution, before the 29 May 1999 inauguration of the new civilian president. The constitution includes provisions for a bicameral legislature, the National Assembly consisting of a 360-member House of Representatives and a 109-member Senate.\n\n\n== Fourth Republic ==\n\n\n=== Presidency Obasanjo (1999‚Äì2007) ===\n\nThe emergence of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 ended 39 years of coups, countercoups and short-lived democracies. Olusegun Obasanjo inherited a country suffering economic stagnation and the deterioration of most democratic institutions. Obasanjo had an adventurous life that also reflected the first 40 years of independent Nigeria: During the civil war, he was a colonel and organised the decisive strike against the Republic of Biafra, as Chief of Staff he escaped an attempt on his life through mistaken identity and was subsequently, between 1977 and 1979, military ruler (without having aspired to this), led Nigeria back to democracy, served time in prison under Abacha and during this time awaited his execution for alleged high treason.\n\n\n==== First term in office ====\nSecuring power\nIn the first months of his presidency, Obasanjo retired some 200 military officers, including all 93 who held political office, making a coup by senior officers less likely. He also moved the Ministry of Defence from Lagos to Abuja and ensured that it was placed under more direct government control.\nActive foreign policy\nThe IV. Republic was able to repair the damage caused by the Abacha dictatorship through an active foreign policy. In October 2001, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, South African President Thabo Mbeki and Algerian President Abd al-Aziz Bouteflika established the New Partnership for Africa's Development, or NEPAD, which aims to strengthen Africa's growth, development and participation in the global economy. During Obasanjo's first term in office, Nigerians' freedoms increased; freedom of the press allowed for the first time to criticise the president again.\nCommunal violence\nCommunal violence has plagued the Obasanjo government since its inception. In May 1999, violence erupted in Kaduna State over the succession of an Emir resulting in more than 100 deaths. In November 1999, the army destroyed the town of Odi, Bayelsa State and killed scores of civilians in retaliation for the murder of 12 policemen by a local gang. In Kaduna in February‚ÄìMay 2000, over 1,000 people died in rioting over the introduction of criminal Shar'ia in the State. Hundreds of ethnic Hausa were killed in reprisal attacks in south-eastern Nigeria. In September 2001, over 2,000 people were killed in inter-religious rioting in Jos. In October 2001, hundreds were killed, and thousands displaced in communal violence that spread across the states of Benue, Taraba, and Nasarawa. On 1 October 2001, Obasanjo announced the formation of a National Security Commission to address the issue of communal violence. Obasanjo was reelected in 2003.\n\n\n==== Second term in office ====\nObasanjo was re-elected in 2003 in a tumultuous election with violent ethnic and religious undertones.\nIn his second term, Obasanjo ensured the expansion of the Nigerian police force.\nIn October 2005, the Obasanjo government repaid all its debts (in exchange for a reduction) under the Paris Club.\nDispute over the Bakassi Peninsula\nObasanjo was also faced with resolving an ongoing border dispute with neighbouring Cameroon over the ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, an oil-rich area with close cultural ties to both countries. According to a 2002 ruling by the International Court of Justice, the region was recognised as belonging to Cameroon. Despite domestic protests, Obasanjo followed the court's decision in 2006, renounced his claims to the peninsula and withdrew his troops.\nOn 12 June 2006, Obasanjo signed the Greentree Agreement with Cameroonian President Paul Biya, which formally ended the border dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula. Even when the Nigerian Senate passed a resolution declaring the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi Peninsula illegal, Obasanjo gave the order to proceed with it as planned. On 14 August 2008, the peninsula was fully handed over to Cameroon.\nConflict in the Niger Delta\n\nDemonstrations against the government's oil policy and high petrol prices had been on the agenda in Nigeria for some time. The inhabitants of the Niger Delta also protested against the activities of the oil companies in their area, which they felt were exploiting the country and giving back too little of their profits. The protests turned into coordinated militant actions in 2006: Oil company employees were kidnapped and refineries and pipelines were damaged. Rebels tried to disrupt oil production and thus cause economic damage to the companies. The most active of these militant groups was the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND). The movement announced a unilateral ceasefire in 2008 and accepted an amnesty programme proposed by the government in 2009.\nEthnic violence over control of the oil-producing Niger Delta region and an insurgency in the north-east continued. Conflicts between Muslims and Christians in Plateau state prompted Obasanjo to declare a state of emergency in May 2004, suspend the state government and install a six-month military government. Obasanjo was able to largely repair the diplomatic damage caused by the Abacha dictatorship through an active foreign policy (for example, by rejoining the Commonwealth).\n\n\n==== Plans for a third term in office ====\nObasanjo tried to amend the constitution to allow him a third term in office - a process that often heralds the transition to another dictatorship in other African countries in the region. This led to tensions with the parliament and with Vice President Atiku Abubakar. An autobiography by Condoleezza Rice claims that the then US President George W. Bush ultimately convinced Obasanjo to abandon these plans. Today (2023), Obasanjo comments on Nigerian politics in an idiosyncratic way.\n\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nAlthough the elections that brought Obasanjo to power and allowed him to run for a second term were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria made significant progress in democratisation. The fact that the National Assembly was able to successfully deny the president a third term despite his influence on the army and security forces is evidence of the checks and balances in the Nigerian Government after 2000.\nThe federalist structure of the 1999 constitution with 36 federal states(and one Federal Capital Territory, FCT) of roughly equal size, a Senate with three senators from each state, as well as a blocking minority of at least 13 states in the presidential election must be considered a stroke of luck in view of the numerous ethnic groups and the religious division of the country. Since then, every presidential candidate has emphasised in their own interest that they represent not only their own ethnic group/religion, but all Nigerians. Nigerian parties now differentiate themselves primarily in terms of their programmes and no longer according to ethnic affiliations.\n\n\n=== Presidency Yar'Adua (2007‚Äì2010) ===\nAs Obasanjo was no longer allowed to run in the 2007 presidential election, Umaru Yar'Adua entered the race as the Muslim candidate for the PDP. Umaru Yar'Adua was the brother of Obasanjo's deputy during his time as military dictator.\nUmaru Yar'Adua won with a clear majority and was sworn in as the new president on 29 May 2007. International observers strongly condemned the election, which was marred by irregularities and vote rigging. The international community, which had observed the Nigerian elections to promote a free and fair process, condemned these elections as seriously flawed. Outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo acknowledged fraud and other \"shortcomings\" in the elections, but stated that the result was in line with the opinion polls. In a nationally televised address in 2007, he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his hand-picked successor, they had the option of voting again in four years' time. However, Yar'Adua's health would soon render this option moot.\nIn 2009, Yar'Adua's term of office saw the out-of-court settlement of lawsuits under the US Alien Tort Statute against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary. Shell continues to deny liability.\n\n\n=== Presidency Jonathan (2010‚Äì2015) ===\n\nYar'Adua died on 5 May 2010. 3 months earlier, Vice President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan had already been sworn in as the successor to Yar'Adua, who was seriously ill and receiving treatment abroad.\nFor the remainder of his term in office, his priorities were to solve the country's energy problems and to continue peace negotiations with the rebels in the Niger Delta.\nJonathan emerged victorious from the presidential elections. Second place went to former General and Head of State Muhammadu Buhari, who received 32 per cent of the vote. The international media reported that the elections went smoothly, unlike previous elections.\n\n\n==== Successes against Ebola and in the entertainment industry ====\nJonathan's time in office saw the successful fight against Ebola and an economic recovery that made Nigeria the leading economic power in Africa. The Jonathan administration's film promotion for high-quality productions created its own commercially successful film industry (\"Nollywood\"), which can only be compared to the US and India (\"Bollywood\").\n\n\n==== Fight against Boko Haram ====\n\nOn the debit side of the balance sheet, on the other hand, is the wave of terror by Boko Haram, which kidnapped 200 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014 and highlighted the impotence of the Nigerian state (around 100 of the girls are still missing in 2022).\nJonathan, who was criticised during the 2014 election campaign for not having done enough to combat Boko Haram, asked the neighbouring countries of Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger for support. A regional army was set up with troops from Nigeria and the aforementioned countries and an offensive was launched against the terrorists. The fight against Boko Haram made significant progress, with armed forces recapturing large areas previously held by the terrorist group.\n\n\n==== Law against queer people ====\nThe Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, signed by Jonathan in 2014, is one of the most repressive laws in the world against LGBT people and those who may be considered by the Nigerian judiciary as their \"sponsors\". The law is also supported by the general Nigerian population. They even went on to praise him for ensuring that the law had been passed and signed.[1]\n\n\n==== Embezzlement of state funds, deselection ====\nAbove all, however, Jonathan's time in office is characterised by embezzlement in office - the misappropriation of state funds. The Nigerian state is said to have lost 20 billion US dollars as a result. The high level of corruption was a decisive factor in the 2015 presidential election, from which opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari emerged victorious. The elections were originally scheduled for mid-February, but were then postponed by the Nigerian electoral commission by six weeks, as the level of violence emanating from Boko Haram at the time was an obstacle to the elections in the north-east.\nJonathan's ouster is (as of 2023) the only case in the IV Republic in which Nigerian voters refused to re-elect an incumbent president. Jonathan's party, the PDP, lost power after 16 years in power. At least it can be said of Jonathan that he conceded his electoral defeat without complaint.\n\n\n=== Presidency Buhari (2015‚Äì2023) ===\n\nSince the Second Republic, Buhari has been seen as the clean man of Nigerian politics, as frugal, but also as a representative of northern interests. His party, the \"All Progressives\", was only formed shortly before his election in 2015 from a merger of four opposition parties. The election, in which the then 72-year-old Buhari won on his fourth attempt, was described by observers as fair. In 2019, Buhari was elected for a second and final term in office and the Progressives remain the ruling party to this day (November 2024). During Buhari's two terms in office, they were able to gradually increase the number of deputies, senators and governors. The Buhari era (as of January 2023) is characterised by a dynamic structural policy, economic diversification, successes against Boko Haram and a decreasing perception of corruption, but also by a rapid increase in armed crime and police attacks. While the COVID-19 pandemic played no role in the young Nigerian population from 2020, in 2022 Nigeria, as the world's largest wheat importer, was hit particularly hard by the wheat shortage caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting rise in bread prices.\n\n\n==== Anti-corruption measures ====\nOne of Buhari's anti-corruption measures promised in the 2015 election was the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen. Investigations by the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB, a kind of ethics council) and complaints by a citizens' initiative had revealed that Onnoghen held secret accounts and did not declare incoming income. After Onnoghen failed to appear on two CCB summonses in January 2019, he was suspended by Buhari. Onnoghen avoided impeachment by the Nigerian Senate (similar to the German Federal Council) by resigning. In December 2019, the Attorney General, Mohammed Bello Adoke, was convicted of corruption in absentia and later extradited from neighbouring Niger. In July 2020 - not without irony - the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry against Corruption EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, was arrested for corruption. In December 2020, he was followed by the Chairman of the Pension Taskforce, Abdulrasheed Maina, and a senator - Since corruption takes place in secret and is an emotionally charged issue, an objective assessment is difficult. However, unlike in the 2015 election, Nigerians no longer see corruption as the most important political issue in the 2022 polls, but place it behind \"fighting crime\", \"economy\" and \"power supply\". This improvement is not reflected in the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) - instead, this assessment of Nigeria by 11 international NGOs has worsened by several points since 2015.\n\n\n==== Infrastructure policy with Chinese help ====\nThe Buhari administration has renovated and rebuilt roads, harbours, bridges and railways like no previous government. The construction and profitable operation of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway since May 2021 as well as the Second Niger Bridge near Onitsha and the Lekki Super Post-Panamax container port, both of which were completed in December 2022, deserve special mention. The Buhari administration has been able to attract or set up processing industries for commodities such as crude oil and rice (e.g. Dangote refinery, Imota rice mill). Major Nigerian entrepreneurs such as Aliko Dangote (cement), Innocent Chukwuma (Innoson, vehicle manufacturing) and Stella Chinyelu Okoli (Emzor Pharma) no longer take their assets abroad, but invest them at home. - Initially, most of the structural improvements were financed and implemented as PPP projects as part of the People's Republic of China's increased involvement in Africa via the state-owned companies CCECC and CHEC, while Western countries hardly participated in such projects. However, when the Nigerian-Chinese negotiations on further projects failed in 2021, Construction Minister Fashola was able to arrange financing for two new rail projects in a short time via the British Standard Chartered Bank. Nigeria is the only sub-Saharan country that operates more kilometres of rail track in 2023 than in colonial times, and one of the few countries in the world that is expanding its rail network every year instead of closing tracks.\n\n\n==== Successes against Boko Haram ====\nBuhari's strategy against Boko Haram was effective despite some setbacks. The terrorist militia was driven out of the most important cities in the afflicted north as early as 2016 (see chapter \"Boko Haram\"). The situation eased at the beginning of 2022, when Boko Haram, whose militias had terrorised Nigeria's north for years and devastated entire regions, was largely disbanded. 40,000 Boko Haram fighters surrendered. However, the splinter group ISWAP remains active. In addition, Nigeria has been hit by a wave of crime and rampant police violence since 2019.\nDespite the political stability, the security situation in Nigeria was considered inadequate. 68% of Nigerians felt \"not safe\" in their country according to a survey by the NOI-Polls opinion research institute in May 2022. 77% do not know a helpline number for emergencies.\nAccording to the above survey, Nigerians fear being robbed (24%) or kidnapped (also 24%), falling victim to armed bandits or being robbed (both 8%) or being harmed in the herdsmen-farmers conflict (also 8%). This is followed by \"ritual murders\" (4%) and \"Boko Haram\" (3.5%).\n\n\n==== Militant groups in the Niger Delta ====\nThe Buhari administration was able to temporarily appease militant groups in the Niger Delta through \"guard contracts\" and the associated payments. Critics see this as a modern-day indulgence trade or the subsidisation of criminals. See the relevant chapter.\n\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\nIn November 2022, the US State Department removed Nigeria (and India) from the list of Countries of Particular Concern. This was done at the recommendation of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) with reference to attacks by criminals against Christian missionaries in the Islamic north of Nigeria. Nigeria was placed on the aforementioned list in 2020 by then President Trump and his Secretary of State Pompeo.\n\n\n=== Presidency Tinubu (since 2023) ===\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, won the February 2023 presidential 2023 Nigerian presidential election to succeed Muhammadu Buhari as the next president of Nigeria. This However, the opposition had accusations of electoral fraud in polls and had challenged it in court. The supreme Court however upheld the victory of President Bola Tinubu till date he remains the Current Elected president of Nigeria.  On 29 May 2023, Bola Tinubu was sworn in as Nigeria's president to succeed Buhari.\nIn his inaugural speech, Tinubu announced the abolition of state subsidies for fuel, and three weeks later he ended state support for the national currency, which subsequently plummeted to a quarter of its value. The situation since then has been described in the Nigerian media as ‚Äòeconomic hardship‚Äô. According to an opinion poll conducted by API on 29 May 2024, 49% of Nigerians surveyed rate Tinubu's work after one year in office as ‚Äòvery bad‚Äô, 29% as ‚Äòbad‚Äô and only 4% as ‚Äògood‚Äô. The biggest personal challenge cited by 36% of respondents was ‚Äòhunger‚Äô, 28% were unable to finance ‚Äòbasic needs‚Äô, 13% were unable to find a job and 9% criticised the poor security situation (multiple answers were not permitted).\nThe rise in kidnappings is also likely to be a consequence of ‚Äòeconomic hardship‚Äô. According to NOIPolls, 38% of Nigerians personally know a kidnap victim (as of May 2024). Of these 38%, 78% state that the victim was released and 57% that a ransom was paid. 5% of victims were killed. 56% of Nigerians believe that the government is not doing enough to combat the numerous kidnappings. Creating jobs (37%) and improving the security forces (22%) are cited as suitable countermeasures.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Africa\nHistoriography of the British Empire\nHistory of West Africa\nList of heads of government of Nigeria\nList of heads of state of Nigeria\nPolitics of Nigeria\nBoko Haram\nHistory of cities in Nigeria:\nIbadan history and timeline\nKano history and timeline\nLagos history and timeline\nPort Harcourt history and timeline\nNational Archives of Nigeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"The Rich History of Nigeria: From Ancient Civilizations to Modern Achievements\".

      "summary": "The history of Nigeria can be traced to the earliest inhabitants whose date remains at least 13,000 BC through the early civilizations such as the Nok culture which began around 1500 BC. Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the Kingdom of Nri, the Benin Kingdom, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa Kingdom during the 11th century, while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal to the Kingdom of Warri. The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. Through contact with Europeans, early harbour towns such as Calabar, Badagry and Bonny emerged along the coast after 1480, which did business in the transatlantic slave trade, among other things. Conflicts in the hinterland, such as the civil war in the Oyo Empire, meant that new enslaved people were constantly being \"supplied\".\nAfter 1804, Usman dan Fodio unified an immense territory in his jihad against the superior but quarrelling Hausa states of the north, which was stabilised by his successors as the \"Caliphate of Sokoto\".\nIn its initial endeavour to stop the slave trade in West Africa, the United Kingdom gradually expanded its sphere of influence after 1851, starting from the tiny island of Lagos (3 km2) and the port city of Calabar. The British followed expansive trading companies such as the RNC and missionaries such as Mary Slessor, who advanced into the hinterland, preached and founded missionary schools, but also took action against local customs such as the religiously induced killing of twins or servants of deceased village elders and against the Trial by ordeal as a means of establishing the legal truth. At the Berlin Congo Conference in 1885, the European powers demarcated their spheres of interest in Africa without regard to ethnic or linguistic boundaries and without giving those affected a say. Thereafter, the British made increasing advances in the Niger region, which they had negotiated in Berlin, and ultimately defeated the Sokoto Caliphate. From 1903, Great Britain controlled almost the entire present-day territory of Nigeria, which was united under a single administration in 1914 (in 1919, a border strip of the former German colony of Cameroon was added to the territory of Nigeria).\nUnder the British colonial administration, purchasing cartels (of companies such as Unilever, Nestl√© and Cadbury) kept the prices of cocoa, palm oil and peanuts artificially low, thereby damaging Nigerian agriculture, but on the other hand ports and an extensive railway network were also built. Newspapers, political parties, trade unions and higher education institutions were established - rather against the wishes of the colonial rulers in order to control the oversized colony. In the East African campaign of 1941, Nigerian regiments achieved the first major success against the Axis powers with the fastest military advance in history at the time. In 1956, oil fields were discovered in Nigeria. Since then, vandalism, oil theft and illegal, unprofessional refining by local residents have caused the contamination of the Niger Delta with crude and heavy oil, particularly around disused exploratory boreholes.\nNigeria became independent in 1960. From 1967 to 1970, the \"Biafra War\" raged in the south-east - one of the worst humanitarian disasters of modern times. After three decades mostly of increasingly restrictive military dictatorships, Nigeria became a democratic federal republic based on the US model in 1999. Quadrennial elections are criticised as \"non-transparent\". Nevertheless, changes of power in the presidential villa at Aso Rock took place peacefully in 2007, 2010, 2015 and 2023, making Nigeria one of the few stable democracies in the region - despite its shortcomings. The Boko Haram revolt of 2014, which received much attention in the West, fell apart due to infighting and the united approach of Nigeria and its neighbours. The spread of the Ebola epidemic to the slums of Lagos in the same year was prevented by professional crisis management. Recent years have seen the rise of the Nigerian music and film industry and success in software programming with five out of seven African tech unicorns. With large new refineries, the country attempts since January 2024 to process the extracted domestic crude oil on its own and in a professional manner in the future (meaning without heavy oil as a waste product).\nThe biggest security problem is the numerous kidnappings, 38% of Nigerians personally know a kidnap victim. Due to the abrupt economic turnaround in 2023, 64% of Nigerians are hungry or cannot finance basic needs. 78% rate the work of President Tinubu as ‚Äòpoor‚Äô or ‚Äòvery poor‚Äô.\n\n",

      "title": "Bussa, Nigeria",
      "content": "Bussa, also known as Boussa in older texts, was one of the main cities and kingdoms of the Borgu federation in northern Nigeria. It was the farthest navigable point on the Niger River from the coast, just above the rapids. The town site is now covered by Lake Kainji, which was created in 1968 with the construction of the Lake Kainji dam. The town was re-located to what is now called New Bussa.\n\n\n== History ==\nBussa was founded by Woru, the eldest son of Kisra, and the became point from which the Wasangari spread throughout Borgu. They developed a political system that incorporated the indigenous Karabonde earth-priests as important members of the royal court. Although it is the oldest and traditional leader of the Borgu confederacy, Bussa was sometimes overshadowed by the more economically and politically powerful city of Nikki.\nBussa was attacked by the Songhai Empire in the 1490s, in 1505, and again in the middle of the 1500s. Despite fierce resistance, the Songhai occupied the city and devastated the surrounding region. After the collapse of the Songhai Empire in 1593, the Oyo Empire moved in and reduced Bussa to a tributary. This lasted until 1783, when Borgu regained independence by defeating Oyo at Gberegburu. \nIn 1806, British explorer Mungo Park drowned near Bussa while on his second expedition to trace the course of the Niger River. Richard Lander (1804‚Äì1834) an explorer relates that after the death of Mungo Park, the inhabitants of Bussa were attacked by a raging epidemic, which was regarded as a visitation from heaven. \"Take care not to touch the whites lest you perish like the people...\"\nBy the 1820s, Oyo was a shell of its former self. Fulani jihadists had taken control of Ilorin and ransacked the capital. Alaafin Oluewu looked to Borgu, which was also suffering raids, to join him in an 1837 effort to push back the Muslims. The king of Bussa joined an army led by Siru Kpera, the king of Nikki, which had initial success but eventually suffered a calamitous defeat. Of the main leaders, only the Bussawa escaped. \nDuring 1894-1898 Bussa was disputed between Great Britain and France. In 1897, Bussa became part of the British Niger Coast protectorate.In 1915, an uprising took place in Bussa against the British policy of indirect rule. In 1920 the Emir of Bussa converted to Islam, and the population gradually followed his example in the following decades.\n\n\n== References and sources ==\nReferences\n\nSources\nAdekunle, Julius (2008). \"The Wasangari: Politics and Identity in Borgu\".

      "title": "Gobir",
      "content": "Gobir (Demonym: Gobirawa) was a traditional state in what is now Nigeria. Founded by the Hausa in the 12th century, Gobir was one of the seven original kingdoms of Hausaland, and continued under Hausa rule for nearly 700 years. Its capital was the city of Alkalawa. In the early 19th century elements of the ruling dynasty fled north to what is today Niger from which a rival dynasty developed ruling as Sarkin Gobir (Sultan of Gobir) at Tibiri. In 1975 a reunited traditional sultanate took up residence in Sabon Birni, Nigeria.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nAccording to records preserved by the Gobir ruling house, they trace their descent from the nomadic Copts (or Kibdawa) of Arabia. They are said to have migrated from Kabila, north of Mecca, to Gubur in Yemen, where they established their first king (Sarkin Gobir), Bana Turmi. From there, they passed through Khartoum and Bornu to Asben, Surukul, Birnin Lalle, Magali, and finally Goran Rami.:‚Ää367‚Äì368‚Ää\nHistorians S. J. Hogben and A. H. M. Kirk-Greene noted that this claim is disputed by some and might have been an invention of Bawa Jan Gwarzo (r. 1777‚Äì1795) to avoid paying tribute (murgu) to Bornu.:‚Ää368‚Ää British historian Murray Last observes that Egyptian merchants before the 15th century seem to have given the Asben region the Coptic name 'Gubir'. He also points out that the Coptic word for henna is kouper, and it may not be a coincidence that the one time Gobir capital is named Birnin Lalle ('city of henna'). The document Kitab Asi Sultanati Ahyar I (\"Chronicle of the Sultanate of Ayr I\") mentions the Gobirawa as having migrated out of Agadez (Ayr).:‚Ää26‚Äì27‚Ää\nA manuscript in the possession of the alkali (chief judge) of Sabon Birni sheds more light on the tradition. According to this manuscript, Muhammad, the Islamic prophet, called on Bana Turmi to support him against his enemy Haibura. Wanting to be on the winning side, Bana Turmi sent half of his retainers to support Muhammad and the other half to Haibura. Haibura lost the battle and was slain at Badr.:‚Ää368‚Ää\nAfter the battle, Muhammad saw a group of Gobirawa fleeing and ordered them to be captured. When they were brought before him, he asked why they had fled, as victory was theirs. They revealed that they had been fighting for Haibura, exposing Bana Turmi's duplicity. Muhammad then declared that the Gobirawa would suffer from divided counsel and internal dissension until the end of time.:‚Ää368‚Ää\nBana Turmi then led the Gobirawa out of Yemen and died at the salt wells of Bilma. His grandson, Bala, then led the Gobirawa further west into the land of Asben, where they aligned with the Idirfunawa of the Adrar against the Tuaregs.:‚Ää368‚Ää\nAccording to historian Boub√© Gado, some claim that Bana Turmi, whose actual name is Bawo na Turmi, was the son of Bawo and the grandson of Bayajidda. This connects the Gobir tradition with the more well known Bayajidda legend of Daura.\n\n\n=== Early history (12th century to 17th century) ===\nGobir was one of the seven original kingdoms of Hausaland, tracing a lineage back to the 11th century. It was the northernmost of the Hausa states and was depended on to protect its sister states from northern adversaries, particularly the Tuareg tribes. From its founding, Gobir had a proud martial reputation, likely stemming from its long history of nomadism.:‚Ää368‚Ää\nAlthough the majority of the Gobirawa ('people of Gobir') were Hausa, the ruling dynasty claimed Coptic descent, marking under their eyes with \"the same mark found under the eye of the Pharaohs on the monuments,\" called takin kaza ('the fowl's footprint') in Hausa. This ruling house descended from Bana Turmi, the first Sarkin Gobir, who died at Bilma. They arrived in the Asben region between the 12th and 14th centuries, establishing a state with the Idirfunawa (Hausawa in Adrar) they met there.:‚Ää369‚ÄäBy the 15th century, Gobir had 'many villages inhabited by shepherds and other herdsmen,' according to Leo Africanus. It utilised its large number of artisans and linen weavers to produce and export textiles and shoes, 'made like those of the ancient Romans,' as far as Timbuktu and Gao through Wangara traders. However, due to constant pressure from the Tuaregs, its economy suffered, and the Gobirawa were forced to move southwards. The Tuaregs had established the Sultanate of Agadez earlier in the century, replacing Gobir as the dominant power in the A√Ør mountains.\nAfter fleeing Asben, the Gobirawa first moved to Maigali and later to Goran Rami, near present-day Sabon Birni. In the early 18th century, they moved their capital to Birnin Lalle. According to the German geographer Heinrich Barth, who explored the region in the mid 19th century, after their conquest, the Gobirawa agreed with the Tuaregs that they would not be exterminated and that Tuareg kings should always marry a black woman.:‚Ää369‚Ää\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\n\n==== Soba's reign ====\nAround 1715, together with Agadez, Gobir aided Zamfara in its successful revolt against Kebbi, which at the time was the dominant power in western Hausaland. This alliance strengthened the relationship between the Gobirawa and the Zamfarawa. The Gobirawa continued to move peacefully into the fertile Zamfara region, a process that began early in the 18th century. The rulers of Zamfara initially welcomed them as useful warriors and granted them farms. However, the relationship soon deteriorated after Sarkin Gobir Soba besieged Zabarma for three years, plundering on a large scale.\n\nAfterward, Soba led his forces across the Niger River to ravage Gurma. They continued the campaign as far south as Ilorin in Yorubaland. Some of the Gobirawa remained in Ilorin, eventually settling there permanently. The Gobirawa community continued to thrive in Ilorin, leading to a close relationship between the Yoruba and the Gobirawa. Today, they are represented in the Ilorin Emirate Council by the Sarkin Gobir of Ilorin.Soba resumed his wars in the mid-18th century, attacking a former ally, Katsina. While the Gobirawa were engaged in a seven-year siege against the Katsina city of Maradi, Agadez descended upon Goran Rami, the capital of Gobir. The Zamfarawa immediately came to Gobir's aid, secretly surrounding the Agadez forces at night with a fence of thorns before launching an attack.\nUpon his return after the failed siege of Maradi, Soba immediately set out for revenge, sacking the Agadez cities of Manni and Adrar. However, his army eventually grew tired of the incessant campaigning and deserted him. Consequently, he was killed by Agadez forces. His son, Gofe, and his daughter, the Magajiya, both fell while fighting beside their father.\n\n\n==== Babari's reign (1742‚Äì1770) ====\nSoba's successor, Uban Iche (or Ibn Ashe), was murdered by his son, Babari. Babari took the title of sarki and immediately led raids into Katsina, Kano, and Shirra in Katagum. After reigning as Sarkin Gobir for 15 years, he began a series of attacks on Zamfara, despite his sister Fara's marriage to Sarkin Zamfara Maroki. The Zamfarawa fiercely defended against these attacks. However, they eventually abandoned their sarki due to his constant taunting whenever they failed to finish off the Gobirawa. Consequently, the Gobirawa ravaged Birnin Zamfara, the capital of Zamfara, with little resistance. Maroki fled to Kiawa, an ancient hill fortress inhabited by Katsinawa, located about twenty miles east of Kaura Namoda.\n\nAccording to Barth, a 'reliable source' informed him that the destruction of Birnin Zamfara happened around 1756, ninety-seven years before his arrival in Hausaland in 1853. Other sources claim that the capital was destroyed in 1762.Babari then established a new capital on the banks of the Gulbin Rima River. He called this new walled town Alkalawa because it was built on the official farmlands (gandu) of the Chief Alkali of Zamfara. These farms were originally given to Gobirawa immigrants by Sarkin Zamfara Malu (or Maliki), the father of Sarkin Zamfara Babba (c. 1715).\n\n\n=== Fall (19th century) ===\nGobir is particularly remembered as the chief opponent of Fulani Islamic reformer Usman dan Fodio. Bawa, a ruler of Gobir, appears to have invited dan Fodio to the area in 1774; dan Fodio made his home in the small town of Degel, and began preaching. Dan Fodio was given some role in the education of Bawa's nephew and later successor, Yunfa (r. 1803‚Äì8), but also publicly attacked what he saw as the abuses of the Hausa elite, particularly the burden they placed on the poor. Sarki Nafata (r. 1797‚Äì98) reversed Bawa's tolerant policy, and feared the increase of arms amongst dan Fodio's followers. The next two rulers vacillated between repressive and liberal measures.\nWhen Yunfa took the throne in 1803, he soon found himself in conflict with dan Fodio, and after failing to assassinate him, exiled dan Fodio and his followers from Degel. Dan Fodio responded by assembling the nomadic Fulani clans into a jihadist army, beginning the Fulani War and eventually establishing the Sokoto Caliphate. Despite some initial successes by the forces of Gobir and the other Hausaland states (most notably at the Battle of Tsuntua), dan Fodio managed to conquer the surrounding territory. His forces seized the Gobir capital, Alkalawa, in October 1808, killing Sarki Yunfa. The state was then partially absorbed into Sokoto.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nResistance against the Jihadists was continued in the north-east by Sarkin Ali dan Yakubu and Sarki Mayaki. With the help of the Hausa ruler of Katsina the latter built a new capital of Gobir in Tibiri, 10 km north of Maradi in 1836. When the Gobir Sultan revolted against the Sokoto Caliphate that same year, Sokoto Sultan Muhammed Bello crushed the rebellion at the Battle of Gawakuke. In present Niger the old dynasty of the Hausa rulers of Gobir is still continued today. A rival branch of the dynasty has its seat in Sabon Birni north of Sokoto in Nigeria.\nThe former Sarkin Gobir Muhammadu Bawa ruled in Sabon Birni from 1975 to 2004.\n\n\n== Administrative structure ==\nLike most of the states of Hausaland, Gobir practiced the sarauta (kingship) system. The head of state was the sarki, appointed by an electoral college known as the Taran Gobir ('Gobir nine'). The grand electors had to reach a unanimous decision on a successor, and this electoral college also served as the sarki's council. The sarki exercised authority through three groups of officials: members of the ruling dynasty, public servants, and governors of towns and regions. The highest-ranking titleholder in Gobir, apart from the sarki, was the ubandawaki ('commander of the cavalry'), who was responsible for overseeing the army.\n\nThe officials of the central government consisted of:\n\nCourt dignitaries who managed palace and city affairs, acting as intermediaries between the sarki and regional governments.\nGuild representatives appointed from skilled craftspeople, such as blacksmiths, weavers, dyers, tanners, masons, butchers, and hunters. They managed relations with various trades and occupations, particularly in collecting state dues.\nRepresentatives of indigenous groups within the state.\nRepresentatives of immigrant groups, each with designated officials. For example, the Sarkin Azbin managed relations with the Tuaregs living in Gobir, while the Sarkin Fulani did the same for the Fulbe.\nThe mallamai (Islamic scholars).\nToday at Tibiri in Niger, a 'rump state' of Gobir still exists, ruled by the pre-jihad aristocracy of Gobir. The head or priest-chief of the animists, known as the Sarkin Anna, is considered the 'brother' and, in some sense, the 'equal' of the Sarkin Gobir. According to local tradition, the Sarkin Anna held a similar position in the original Gobir polity. The Sarkin Anna is also the custodian of the royal regalia of Gobir, which includes a sabre, two bracelets (one gold and one silver), a bow, and a quiver.\nAnother powerful titleholder in Gobir was the Inna, an office typically given to the sarki's sister. She served as the high priestess of the Bori cult, representing the Takurabow or Inna Baka ('the Black Inna'), the dynastic goddess of Gobir.\n\n\n== Rulers of Gobir ==\nThis sections lists the holders of the title of Sarkin Gobir ('lord of Gobir').:‚Ää415‚Äì417‚Ää The list is derived from the Sokoto Provincial Gazetteer compiled by P G Harris, a British colonial administrator. Other lists exist, including one by E J Arnett (another colonial official), which was based on a list found at Yankaba (located in Nassarawa, Kano). Although there are discrepancies, especially in the earlier names, all known lists agree on Bana Turmi as the first king.:‚Ää415‚Äì417\n\n\n=== Gubur in Arabia and later at Suakin ===\n\n\n=== Khartoum ===\n\n\n=== Bornu ===\n\n\n=== Asben ===\n\n\n=== Alkalawa ===\n\n\n==== Family tree of the rulers of Gobir at Alkalawa ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citation ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\"Usman dan Fodio.\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, accessed September 30, 2005.\nF.

      "summary": "Gobir (Demonym: Gobirawa) was a traditional state in what is now Nigeria. Founded by the Hausa in the 12th century, Gobir was one of the seven original kingdoms of Hausaland, and continued under Hausa rule for nearly 700 years. Its capital was the city of Alkalawa. In the early 19th century elements of the ruling dynasty fled north to what is today Niger from which a rival dynasty developed ruling as Sarkin Gobir (Sultan of Gobir) at Tibiri. In 1975 a reunited traditional sultanate took up residence in Sabon Birni, Nigeria.\n\n",

      "title": "History of Northern Nigeria",
      "content": "The history of Northern Nigeria covers the history of the region form pre-historic times to the modern period of Northern Nigerian state.\n\n\n== Pre-History ==\n\nThe Nok culture, an ancient culture dominated most of what is now Northern Nigeria in pre historic times, its legacy in the form of terracotta statues and megaliths have been discovered in Sokoto, Kano, Birinin Kudu, Nok and Zaria. The Kwatarkwashi culture, a variant of the Nok culture centred mostly around Zamfara in Sokoto Province is thought by some to be the same or an offshoot of the Nok.\n\n\n== The Kanem-Bornu Empire ==\n\nThe history of Borno is closely linked to that of Kanem, which grew into an empire in the Lake Chad basin in the 13th century. At times, it extended as far as Fezzan in southern Libya. The Mai (king) of Kanem and his court adopted Islam in the 11th century, just as the western empires had done. Islam was used to strengthen the political and social structures of the state, although many established customs were retained. Thus women continued to exert considerable political influence, especially the Magira (Queen Mother) and the Magara (the official ‚Äúelder sister‚Äù of Mai).:‚Ää72‚Äì73‚Ää\n\nThe first ruler of Kanem was Saif, who founded his dynasty, the Sayfawa, which ruled the empire for a millennium (800 AD to 1846 AD).:‚Ää74‚Ää The first Muslim ruler of Kanem was Mai Umme Jilmi (r. 1085-1097), who died on his way to Mecca in Egypt. His son and successor Dunama I (r. 1097-1150) is said to have made two pilgrimages to Mecca and was drowned by Egyptians near Suez on his third pilgrimage. In the late 12th century, Kanem maintained diplomatic relations with Tunisia. At this time, Kanem also maintained a madrasa (hostel) in Cairo, which was intended for students and pilgrims from his territory. Due to Kanem's growing influence in North Africa and the territorial expansion it achieved in the 12th and 13th centuries, the empire became very well known in the Islamic world of the time.:‚Ää75‚Ää‚Ää\nThe Mai/King deployed his bodyguards and an army of nobles to extend his authority from Kanem to Borno. The civil war that disrupted Kanem in the second half of the 14th century led to the independence of Bornu. The Sayfawa, who fled to Bornu, were severely weakened by the dynastic struggles in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. Mai Ali Ghaji (r. 1470-1508) established a large capital called Birnin N'gazargamu, which was the center of Bornu. Ali Ghaji carried out government reforms and put an end to civil unrest. With a reinvigorated army, he extended Bornu's influence to neighboring regions and even demanded tribute from some Hausa states. He also re-established diplomatic relations with North Africa. Ali's successors kept Kanem as a province of Bornu until the 19th century.:‚Ää77‚Äì78‚Ää‚Ää\nThe most wealthy period in the history of the empire was the reign of Idris Alauma (1571‚Äì1603). Its documentation is due to the Imam Ahmed ibn Fartua, who recorded the first twelve years of Alauma's reign. Alauma ascended the throne after an interregnum during which Bornu was ruled by his mother Aicha. Shortly after his accession to the throne, he procured Turkish musketeers from North Africa as well as horses, camels and various weapons for his troops in order to strengthen Bornu's military power. He led numerous campaigns to pacify Bornu's neighbors and conquer territories. His troops carried out far-reaching campaigns: in the north from Fezzan in southern Libya to Kawar in northern Niger; in the east from the Kanem region in eastern Chad to the Mandara region in northern Cameroon; in the south he crushed the rebellion of a Marghi prince; and in the west he subdued Kano and demanded tribute from the Hausa states. In addition to waging war, Alauma also carried out administrative reforms. He began to replace customary law with Shari'a (Islamic Law) in certain matters and appointed qadis (judges) to rule on legal matters independently of the traditional rulers. He encouraged the construction of several mosques, which were built from baked bricks instead of reeds. He also undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca and financed the construction of a hostel for the Bornu pilgrims there.:‚Ää79‚Äì82‚Ää\nThe economy of Borno was dominated by the Trans-Sudanese slave trade and the desert trade in salt and livestock. The need to protect its trading interests forced Borno to intervene in Kanem from the 15th to 16th centuries. Despite its relative political weakness during this period, the court and mosques of Borno gained a reputation as centers of Islamic culture and scholarship under the patronage of a series of skillful kings.\n\n\n== The Fourteen Kingdoms ==\n\nIn the 9th century a set kingdoms emerged in Northern Nigeria to replace the Kabara Nation, these Kingdoms share a similar ethno-historical dynamic cemented in their belief in a common origin. The lore of the Fourteen Kingdoms unify the diverse heritage of Northern Nigeria into a cohesive system. Seven of these Kingdoms developed from the Kabara legacy of the Hausa people. As vibrant trading centers competing with Kanem‚ÄìBornu and Mali slowly developed in the Central Sudan, a set Kingdoms merged dominating the great savannah plains of Hausaland, their primary exports were leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, animal hides, and henna. The Seven Hausa states included:\n\nDaura\nKano 998‚Äì1807\nKatsina c. 1400‚Äì1805\nZazzau (Zaria) c. 1200‚Äì1808\nGobir ?‚Äì1808\nRano\nBiram c. 1100‚Äì1805\nThe growth and conquest of the Hausa Bakwai resulted in the founding of additional states with rulers tracing their lineage to a concubine of the Hausa founding father, Bayajidda. Thus they are called the 'Banza Bakwai meaning Bastard Seven. The Banza Bakwai adopted many of the customs and institutions of the Hausa Bakwai but were considered unsanctioned or copy-cat kingdoms by non-Hausa people. These states include:\n\nZamfara\nKebbi\nYauri (also called Yawuri)\nGwari (also called Gwariland)\nKwararafa (a Jukun state)\nNupe (of the Nupe people)\nIlorin (A yoruba State also known as Kwara)\n\n\n== Hausa States ==\n\nBetween 500 CE and 700 CE, the Hausa people, who are thought to have slowly moved from Nubia and mixing in with the local Northern and Middle Belt population, established a number of strong states in what is now Northern Nigeria and Eastern Niger. With the decline of the Nok and Sokoto, who had previously controlled Central and Northern Nigeria between 800 BCE and 200 CE, the Hausa were able to emerge as the new power in the region. They are closely linked with the Kanuri people of Kanem‚ÄìBornu, Lake Chad, the Bassa people, Birom, Gwari, Nupe and Jukun. The Hausa aristocracy, under influence from the Ghana Empire adopted Islam in the 11th century CE. By the 12th century CE, the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major powers. The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early mosques and palaces are bright and colourful and often include intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade. By 1500 CE, the Hausa utilized a modified Arabic script known as Ajami to record their own language; the Hausa compiled several written histories, the most popular being the Kano Chronicle.\n\n\n== Sokoto Period ==\n\nIn the 19th century, the Fula people led a series of jihads across sudanic Africa. In Northern Nigeria and the central Sudan, Usman dan Fodio led the Fula in a bid to overthrow the Hausa Sultanates. By 1803, a new state known as the Sokoto Caliphate had replaced most of the former sultanates that had held sway over the region. The Sokoto Caliphate was under the overall authority of the Commander of the Faithful. Under Dan Fodio, the Empire was bicephalous and divided into two territories each controlled by an appointed vizier. Each of the territories was further divided into autonomous Emirates under mainly hereditary local Emirs. The Bornu Empire was initially absorbed into the Sokoto Caliphate of Usman dan Fodio, but broke away after a few years later.\n\n\n== Colonial Period ==\n\nThe Initial contact of Northern Nigeria with the British was predominantly trade-related, and revolved around the expansion of the Royal Niger Company, whose interior territories spread north from about where the Niger River and Benue River joined at Lokoja, a place called (Mount Patti Hill).  The Royal Niger Company's territory did not represent a direct threat to much the Sokoto Caliphate or the numerous states of Northern Nigeria. This changed, when Fredrick Lugard and Taubman Goldie laid down an ambitious plan to pacify the Niger interior and unite it with the rest of the British Empire in 1897 Lugard proclaimed a protectorate over Northern Nigeria and hostilities though sporadic soon followed; the Calipharte itself never responded to Lugards onslaught, this allowed him pacify the Emirates one by one. In February 1903, the fort of Kano fell and its slave market closed, sokoto and other regions soon followed. By the early 1920s the last pockets of resistance located in the Kanem had been pacified.\n\n\n== Protectorate Period ==\n\nThe protectorate of Northern Nigeria was proclaimed at Ida by Fredrick Lugard on January 1, 1897. The basis of the colony was the 1885 Treaty of Berlin which broadly granted Northern Nigeria to Britain, on the basis of their protectorates in Southern Nigeria. Hostilities with the powerful Sokoto Caliphate soon followed. The Emirates of Kabba, Kontagora and Ilorin were the first to be conquered by the British. In February 1903, the great fort of Kano, seat of the Kano Emirate was captured, Sokoto and much of the rest of its Caliphate soon capitulated. On March 13, 1903, the Grand Shura of Caliphate finally conceded to Lugard's demands and proclaimed Queen Victoria, Queen and sovereign of the Caliphate and all its lands.\nThe Governor, Frederick Lugard, with limited resources, ruled with the consent of local rulers through a policy of indirect rule which he developed into a sophisticated political theory. Lugard left the protectorate after some years, serving in Hong Kong, but was eventually returned to work in Nigeria where he decided on the merger of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate with Southern Nigeria in 1914. Agitation for independence from the radically different Southern Protectorate however led to a formidable split in the 1940s. The Richards constitution, proclaimed in 1945 gave overwhelming autonomy to the North, including eventually in the areas of foreign relations and customs policy.\n\n\n== 40-year interregnum ==\nFrom 1914 to 1953, the much larger Northern Nigeria was amalgamated with the Nigerian South in the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria, and its administration was virtually controlled from the South. During this period, local government was administered by a string of Lieutenant Governors and Chief Commissioners. In the 1940s agitation for Northernisation led to the Richards and eventually to the Macpherson constitution of 1953, which granted exceptional self-governing powers (including in the areas of foreign policy, customs and border control) to the North.\n\n\n== Independence ==\nNorthern Nigeria was granted independence on March 15, 1953, with Sir Ahmadu Bello as its first premier. the Northern Peoples Congress under Sir Ahmadu Bello dominated parliament while the Northern Elements Progressive Union became the main opposition party.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Igodomigodo",
      "content": "Igodomigodo was an ancient Edo kingdom in modern-day southern Nigeria ruled by the Ogiso monarchy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Legendary origins ===\nThe Edo tradition of origin holds that initially there was no land on earth. Accordingly, Osanobua requested three sons to descend from the sky in a canoe. One son, named Igodo, created land by pouring sand contained in a snail shell on the water, and Osanobua made him king of the Edo and of the world. Some traditions say Igodo was thought to have come from the sky due to his great wisdom. Ogiso hence means \"king from the sky\".\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nRelying on other traditions and archaeological evidence, historians believe that the Edo migrated into Igodogomido from the northeast in the second half of the first millenium CE, intermarrying with the local Efa people and gradually assimilating them to their culture. Some traditions claim that they stayed temporarily at Ile-Ife before settling their present-day homeland. \nIn Jacob Egharevba's first edition of A Short History of Benin (1934), he says the first Ogiso, Obagodo (Igodo), was the eldest son of Oduduwa. His second edition changed to have the Ogiso as having migrated from Egypt, likely influenced by the Hamitic hypothesis. \n\n\n=== Formation of the state ===\nThe process by which the various autonomous Edo and Efa villages developed politically is unclear. Prior to the consolidation of the kingdom, settlements were ruled by Uzama (lineage heads), who would later fulfil the role of kingmakers in Igodomigodo. A prominent village leader named Igodo became Ogiso, or king, sometime in the 10th century CE, likely as a result of a long process of competition between communities. The General History of Africa recorded the Ogiso as a native dynasty to the Edo.:‚Ää512‚Ää Based on early oral sources, Dmitri Bondarenko has argued that Udo, a town located northwest of present-day Benin City, was the first capital of the Ogiso. According to his theory, this Yoruba city-state was a part of the Ife Empire, and a base from which Yoruba invaders conquered the territory, bringing the institution of divine kingship with them. Some historians have Igodo ruling from Ugbekun, a village southeast of Benin city, where he died. \nRegardless of his origins, Ogiso Igodo united various chiefdoms and communities into a single political entity. His efforts to integrate various Bini chiefdoms and promote unity among the people were crucial in consolidating the kingdom. Under Igodo's rule, the kingdom experienced growth and development. He implemented administrative and social reforms that facilitated governance of the unified territory. Igodo's reign saw the beginning of important cultural and religious practices that remained important for centuries, particularly the divine kingship. \n\n\n=== Height ===\nOgiso Ere, the son of Igodo, succeeded his father and worked to further consolidate the kingdom. According to Egharevba, Ere introduced cultural and technological advancements, including the royal throne (ekete), rectangular stool (agba), and round leather fan (ezuzu) through the establishment of Onwina and Igbesanmwan, traditional groups of carpenters and carvers. These attributions are simply copied from the later Oba Ewuare I, however; the two rulers are often conflated in oral tradition. Ere also moved the palace from Ugbekun to Benin. \nQueens such as Emose and Orhorho were also significant figures. Emose was involved in governance, while Orhorho's rule was marked by conflict. Orhorho's oppressive reign ultimately led to her demise. Ogiso Odoligie and Ogiso Uwa expanded the kingdom's influence and integrated various chiefdoms. Their reigns focused on strengthening the kingdom's political and cultural institutions. Ogiso Henenden's rule brought stability and growth to the region, resulting in a significant population increase in Benin City.\n\n\n=== Fall ===\nThe decline of the Ogiso monarchy began with the reign of its last ruler, Ogiso Owodo in the late 12th century. His tenure was marked by internal conflicts, public discontent, ineffective leadership, and a loss of authority and control. Domestic problems, including the barrenness of his wives and the banishment of his only son, Ekaladerhan, further weakened him. \nOwodo was eventually overthrown by the people of the city. In his place they chose Evian, a popular and powerful Ogifa as okaevbo or head of state. Evian's attempt to pass power to his son Ogiamwen, creating a new royal dynasty, was resisted. The Edionevbo (the ruling council of Uzama) refused to sanction the move, and sent emissaries requesting that a prince of Ile-Ife restore order and legitimacy to their throne. Oranmiyan, son of Oduduwa, accepted the council's invitation. Some modern Edo traditions claim that the first Oba, and perhaps Oduduwa himself, was in fact the prince Ekaladerhan, but this has been widely criticised by historians. Prince Oranmiyan married an Edo woman and had a son called Eweka. Some Edo opposed being ruled by an outsider, and, conscious of this (or possibly after conflict), Oranmiyan returned to Ife. In accordance with Oranmiyan's final order, Eweka took the throne, founding the Oba dynasty of the nascent Kingdom of Benin.\n\n\n== Government and society ==\nThe Ogiso were key figures in administering the kingdom, overseeing both political and religious affairs. The capital, perhaps initially located at Udo, was later moved to Benin City, which became the political and cultural center.\nThe social structure of the Ogiso monarchy was hierarchical, with clear roles and responsibilities among the classes. At the top was the Ogiso, holding supreme authority as both a political and religious leader. The Ogiso was supported by a council of chiefs and nobles who were responsible for justice, taxation, and military matters. Chiefs were appointed to oversee different regions, ensuring effective control over the territory. The council also advised the Ogiso on important state matters and served as a link between the central authority and local communities.The Ogiso exercised judicial authority, resolving disputes and ensuring justice within the kingdom. The judicial system was based on customary laws and practices, upheld by the Ogiso and appointed officials. Under the Ogiso, towns were headed by enigie (princes or chiefs) and paid tribute to the Ogiso. Towns were surrounded by earthen walls, which likely demarcated territory rather than serving a defensive purpose. Its economy was mostly agricultural.\nThe social structure included skilled artisans and craftsmen who contributed to the kingdom's economy and cultural development. These individuals were organised into guilds, such as the Onwina (carpenters) and Igbesanmwan (carvers). Their work was integral to the kingdom's religious and cultural practices, producing items used in rituals and daily life. The common people formed the majority of the population, engaging in occupations such as farming, fishing, and trade.\nSlavery was also part of the social structure, with slaves performing labour-intensive tasks. Slaves were often captured during wars and raids or acquired through trade. They were considered the property of their owners and had limited rights and freedoms. However, slaves could sometimes earn their freedom through exceptional service or by being granted manumission.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nReligious practices were integral to the kingdom's administration, with the Ogiso viewed as divine rulers mediating between the spiritual and physical worlds. This divine status was reinforced through rituals and ceremonies emphasising the sacred nature of kingship. Temples and shrines dedicated to various deities played central roles in religious life, with the Ogiso performing rituals to various gods to ensure prosperity and well-being. This status was reflected in the title \"Ogiso,\" meaning \"king from the sky\". Mythology and oral traditions shaped the people's belief systems. Legends and myths about the origins of the Ogiso and their divine lineage were passed down through generations, reinforcing the sacred nature of kingship. Belief in the Ogiso's supernatural powers and their connection to the gods strengthened their authority as rulers.\nThe ancestor cult was also significant, with rituals honouring deceased ancestors and seeking their guidance. The religious and mythological practices during the Ogiso period laid the foundation for the Benin Kingdom's spiritual and cultural identity. Many of these practices evolved and were integrated into the subsequent Oba Dynasty's religious framework. These practices' enduring significance is evident in the cultural traditions and ceremonies observed by the Edo people today.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe Ogiso monarchy is known for its contributions to the arts and crafts, which were significant in the kingdom's cultural development. Skilled craftsmen and artisans emerged during this period, producing intricate works of art, including wood carvings and bronze sculptures. Ogiso Ere's reign in particular saw the establishment of groups of craftsmen, such as the Onwina (carpenters) and Igbesanmwan (carvers). Bronze casting was another significant art form that flourished during the Ogiso period. The lost-wax casting technique created detailed bronze sculptures and plaques depicting various aspects of the kingdom's life, including portraits of rulers, deities, and important events. \nThe artistic heritage of the Ogiso monarchy is evident in the architectural achievements of the period. The construction of town walls, particularly those of Udo, showcases the kingdom's architectural skill. These walls were functional for defence and reflected the kingdom's cultural and artistic achievements. \n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nOgiso monarchy\nList of the Ogiso\nKingdom of Benin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nBondarenko, Dmitri M.

      "title": "Nikki, Benin",
      "content": "Nikki [ni.ki] is a town, arrondissement, and commune located in the Borgou Department of Benin. The commune covers an area of 3171 square kilometres and as of 2002 had a population of 99,251 people.\nNikki is a major centre of the Batonuo people and is home to a traditional king, resident in the centre of the town. The Gaani royal festival is held in the town annually. Before the colonial era, Nikki was one of the main political centers of the Borgu federation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThe capital of the kingdom of Nikki was originally Ou√©nou. Among the ethnic groups and peoples living in Ou√©nou, the Baatoumbou were a hierarchical people with a king at the top with the title Ou√©nou-Sounon. Around 1480, the Wassangari arrived in the region under the leadership of their leader Mansa Doro. S√©ro, his groom, son of Kisra was then chosen as head of the community which remained in the region and which was organized on the model of Ou√©nou-Sounon. He married local Baatoumbou women, and had a son named Sim√©. During a hunting trip, Sim√© identified the site of Nikki. The name derives from the humidity of the site; he said: ‚ÄúYa nik√© ‚Äì nik√©rou san‚Äù (in Bariba: ‚Äúit's humid‚Äù). Sim√© established his residence there but his father S√©ro remained in Ou√©nou.\n\n\n=== Regional Power ===\nNikki became one of the most powerful and important cities in the Borgu confederacy, less prestigious but generally more powerful than the older Bussa. The city's strategic position astride trade routes linking Bondoukou, Gonja and the Ashanti Empire with Hausaland and the Oyo Empire brought it wealth and power. Throughout the 18th century, princes from Nikki fanned out, founding new petty kingdoms under the mother city's patronage all across southern Borgu, including Kandi, Kaiama, Parakou, Natitingou and others. Nikki played a key role in the regional economy, protecting trade routes, signing trade treaties with neighboring powers, and minting the mithqal gold coin that became a common currency in the region.\nIn the 1820s, Fulani jihadists from the Sokoto Caliphate had taken control of Ilorin in the crumbling Oyo Empire. Alaafin Oluewu looked to Borgu, which was also suffering raids, to join him in an 1837 effort to push back the Muslims. Siru Kpera, the Sina Boko of Nikki, led a force bringing together cities from all across Borgu. After several initial successes, the alliance suffered a calamitous defeat and Siru Kpera was killed. With his death, the peripheral princelings under Nikki's influence became increasingly independent and began taxing and raiding trade caravans, undermining the mother city's regional influence.\n\n\n=== Colonial Era ===\nWhen Great Britain and France penetrated the region in the late 19th century, they saw Borgu as an important strategic area. The 1894 'Race for Nikki' saw Frederick Lugard and Capt. Decoeur racing to sign commercial and protectorate treaties with Sina Boko Laffia. Lugard succeeded first, on November 10th, followed by Decoeur on the 26th. The exact border between French and British spheres of influence was settled in 1898, dividing Borgu in two. Nikki was joined to French Dahomey, but its former vassal Parakou was made the center of administration, and the town's importance declined. \n\n\n== Notable people ==\nBenin minister Aur√©lie Adam Soule was born here in 1984.\n\n\n== Climatic Condition ==\nThe year-round climate of Nikki is humid, stifling, and hot, with sporadic lows and highs\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\nAdekunle, Julius (2008). \"The Wasangari: Politics and Identity in Borgu\".
