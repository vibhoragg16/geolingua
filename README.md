GeoLingua
A powerful, multilingual translation engine bridging the gap between languages and geography.

</div>

GeoLingua is an open-source project designed to provide accurate and context-aware translations, with a special focus on handling geographical and location-based named entities. It leverages a sophisticated interlingual representation, allowing it to understand the core meaning of a text before generating the translation in the target language. This approach ensures higher accuracy, especially for complex sentences and low-resource language pairs.

Note: This project is currently under active development. Contributions are welcome!

‚ú® Features
High-Quality Machine Translation: Translate text between multiple languages with high fidelity.

Interlingual Approach: Utilizes a language-agnostic intermediate representation for more robust translations.

Geographical Awareness: Specialised models to correctly identify and translate location names, addresses, and geographical features.

Scalable Architecture: Built to support a growing number of languages without requiring a new model for every language pair.

REST API: Comes with a simple and powerful REST API for easy integration into your own applications.

Customizable: Train and fine-tune models on your own datasets for specific domains.

üöÄ Live Demo
[Provide a link to your hosted application or a live demo if you have one. You can also add a GIF or screenshot here.]

Example: https://your-geolingua-demo.com

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python

Machine Learning Framework: [e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX]

NLP Library: [e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, Fairseq, OpenNMT]

API Framework: [e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Django REST Framework]

Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB] - if applicable

Containerization: Docker

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

(Optional) Git for cloning the repository

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/vibhoragg16/geolingua.git](https://github.com/vibhoragg16/geolingua.git)
cd geolingua

Create and activate a virtual environment:

Linux/macOS:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download pre-trained models and data:
(This is a placeholder. Add instructions on how to get necessary model files, datasets, or other assets.)

# Example:
# python download_models.py
# or provide a gdown/wget link

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can run the application.

Running the API Server
To start the translation API server (powered by FastAPI/Flask):

# Example for FastAPI
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

The API documentation will be available at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Using the API
You can send a POST request to the /translate endpoint.

Example using curl:

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/translate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "What is the capital of France?",
    "source_lang": "en",
    "target_lang": "es"
  }'

Expected Response:

{
  "original_text": "What is the capital of France?",
  "translated_text": "¬øCu√°l es la capital de Francia?",
  "source_lang": "en",
  "target_lang": "es"
}

Running as a Command-Line Tool
(If you provide a CLI, add instructions here.)

python translate.py --text "Hello, world!" --from en --to fr

üèóÔ∏è How It Works
[Provide a brief, high-level overview of your project's architecture. This is a great place to explain your unique approach.]

GeoLingua is built upon an Encoder-Decoder architecture. However, instead of mapping directly from a source language to a target language, we introduce an intermediate step:

Encoder: The source text is fed into a powerful language model (the Encoder) which transforms it into a dense, language-independent vector representation known as the "interlingua". This representation captures the pure semantic meaning of the text.

Interlingua: This is the core of GeoLingua. It's a universal representation that is decoupled from the grammar and vocabulary of any specific language.

Decoder: A language-specific Decoder takes the interlingua representation and generates the final text in the desired target language.

This design allows for greater flexibility and scalability. To add a new language, we only need to train a new encoder/decoder pair to interface with the existing interlingua, rather than training a new model for every possible language combination.
