        "title": "Recent dowry deaths- My own story of dowry to all the young lovely women out there.",
        "selftext": "Happened 1 year ago,\n\nFor context: I was 28/F working as a Doctor of Stroke (Brain) in London earned 1 Crore per annum, pre tax with my locums and regular salary. Still owe the gov of uk 10 grand in taxes, which i have set up a payment plan with.\n\nSo one day, some random unknown distant relative from the same area as the recent Dowry death, UNinvited, came to visit my parent's office in AnnaNagar, Chennai.\n\nThey themselves asked to have tea, which my mom ordered. They announced to my mom and dad that they have a most wonderful boy for me marry within the relatives. They mentioned that this wonderful boy finished his UG 4 years ago and is at home preparing for ias. Honestly good for him, but no one in my family asked. They kept noting to my parents, that my parents have a girl, not a boy, and this boy family has their own big house and earn rental money monthly. The boy apparently has somehow seen me on instagram, which btw has only 12 posts, and somehow thought I am a great fit for him.\n\nThen they asked my mom what will my dad give as dowry.? So my mom just asked what.? He said yes, 'When u keep a girl, you have to keep gold only right, you cant just keep flowers.?' Mom was shocked, dad was fighting urge to slap him just for his depiction of women, mom held dad's hands. Then this relative went on to say that I must quit job and come live with the boy in this small town. Also my dad 'must' take care of marriage expenses which should be like a 'festival' and buy some nice suv car.\n\nYou would imagine this is the end, but no. He noted that I dont have to be a stay-at-home housewife, as they are very generous and I can finish my morning house chores early and open a small tent outside the house and run it as a clinic and earn money, and support it to the boy's family, whilst he is 'studying' for his ias. Safe to say, the not-so-hot tea he was drinking, was thrown in his face. They cursed me and my parents. My mom answered to this man, that I rather be single and happy than be with such people.\n\nFollowing this, we suffered backlash from many of my relatives, stating this relative is only asking what is normal in the world. My parents handled it with grace, and any relatives attempting discussion on this incident/dowry were avoided.\n\nIt all ended well, because i was in love and now I am in line to get married to my love of my life ..!üíç‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nPs: Relatives still are vile and toxic about my wedding. I find it appalling that they would rather I marry this guy from the story than the love of my life (also a doctor in uk)\n\nThankfully I got lucky with my mom and dad, but even if not, I would have just not consented to dowry weddings. The only reason I could do that, was because I am earning my own money and I was educationally and financially independent to say no to everyone. This is my story.",

If you had the chance, would you choose to live in India or move abroad?\n\nNot trying to hate on India or glorify the West blindly, just genuinely curious what people think these days. I‚Äôm in my early 20s, currently studying in India, and like many others, I‚Äôve started wondering where I see myself in the future.\n\nIndia definitely has its pros: family‚Äôs here, cost of living can be lower, and there‚Äôs a comfort in being around your own culture and language. But at the same time, things like pollution, overpopulation, poor infrastructure, and sometimes even how people treat each other really get to me. It can feel exhausting.\n\nOn the flip side, life abroad seems cleaner, more organized, and peaceful, better public systems, work-life balance, and personal space. But then again, there‚Äôs homesickness, racism, high living costs, and feeling like an outsider.\n\nJust curious to hear from people who‚Äôve either moved abroad, come back, or are thinking about this like I am. What would you pick and why?\n\nWould love to hear your perspective, whatever stage you‚Äôre at in life.\n\n",

Among Hindus, I‚Äôm already seen as \"different\" because of my background.

The hypocrisy is exhausting.\n\nI don‚Äôt hate religion. I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone. I just wish I could have open conversations or live honestly without being treated as a threat or outsider.\n\nHas anyone else been through this?

        "selftext": "Municipality elections are supposed to take place in Maharashtra later in the year. BJP really wants to win the Mumbai's BMC to strengthen hold on Mumbai and finish off Thackeray group. Their internal surveys must have indicated that it will be difficult to defeat Thackeray sena in Mumbai even with the help of Shinde sena or MNS. So, they have gone back to their formula of divide & conquer.\n\nBJP govt tried to introduce new rule to impose Hindi language study from 1st standard. this faced a lot of resistance & outcry in Maharashtra from different parts of society. MNS jumped on this opportunity to showcase themselves as Marathi cause Warriors. Raj Thackeray threatened agitation against govt and later MNS workers started their aggressive confrontations against People who dont speak marathi. Common people are not part of these aggressive incidents, its MNS workers mostly.\n\nNow, Mumbai  has 50-50 population of marathi & non-marathi speakers. BJP plans to consolidates non-marathi voters and then snatch some marathi voteshare as well with Hindutva agenda and distributing money and voter fraud of course. They used the same strategy in haryana by consolidating non-jaat votes and in Maharashtra state elections by consolidating non-maratha caste votes. \n\nMNS won 0 zero seats in state elections. So no wonder they see this as a good opportunity to increase their vote share, win some seats and then play king maker in BMC. I in fact think Raj Thackeray & BJP CM Fadnavis might have even discussed such strategy when they met twice at least  this year as reported below.\n\n[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra/fadnaviss-friendly-meet-with-raj-thackeray-sparks-speculation/article69202666.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra/fadnaviss-friendly-meet-with-raj-thackeray-sparks-speculation/article69202666.ece)\n\n[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-talk-of-reunion-of-thackeray-cousins-fadnavis-meets-with-raj-thackeray-101749719055401.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-talk-of-reunion-of-thackeray-cousins-fadnavis-meets-with-raj-thackeray-101749719055401.html)\n\nBihari MP Nishikant dubey recently made comments asking what is Marathi people achieved in maharashtra ? How many business are run by maharashtrian people etc. He claimed that business in maharashtra are successful due to north indian workers working there and ores in bihar producing minerals. Now why is a bihari MP making comments about maharashtra and marathi people now ? cause, BJP also plans to use this image of saviors of non-marathi speakers in upcoming Bihar elections.\n\nSo, BJP & MNS will keep milking this marathi vs non-marathi issue until elections are done. Unfortunately, both shivsena factions are being dragged along the 2 sides. thackeray sena cannot lose marathi voters. shinde sena cannot leave BJP. So they have to stick to each side even if mildly. NCP facyions & Congress havent taken any stance. they seem to have given up on Mumbai for now.\n\nNews media & social have also bought into this battle fully. both make it look like this is a big issue and something is happening every day. But I assure you this not the case. I and many other do think that People living in maharashtra shoud have some basic knowledge of conversing in marathi.  But going around beating up people is not something people agree on. But the absolute arrogance of some people towards marathi language does turn off many marathi people.

I was returning from college, tired, just wanted to reach home, have dinner, and chill.\n\nAs I turned into the Jawahar Circle stretch, I saw a crowd on one side of the road. A man ‚Äî probably late 30s ‚Äî was lying next to a fallen bike. His head was bleeding. Helmet was nowhere to be seen.\n\nAt first, I slowed down out of curiosity, like most people do. But then I noticed no one ‚Äî literally no one ‚Äî was helping him.\n\nPeople were standing there, some recording, some just discussing:\n\n>\n\nI parked my bike on the side and rushed to him. His pulse was weak. I took off my shirt, pressed it against his forehead to stop the bleeding. Called 108 immediately.\n\nI kept talking to him: \"Bhai naam kya hai? Sun sakte ho? Bas thoda sa time hai, ambulance aa rahi hai...\"\n\nWhile I was holding his hand, trying to calm him, I heard murmurs behind me.\n\n>\n\nWhat the actual fck.\\*\n\nThe man was unconscious. He couldn‚Äôt speak. And here I was ‚Äî a stranger ‚Äî trying to help him not die in the middle of the street. But somehow, I had become the suspicious one?\n\nWhen the ambulance arrived, even the staff asked:\n\n>\n\nI just said ‚Äî ‚ÄúNahi sir, par agar koi apna hota toh aap log tak shayad pahuchte hi nahi.‚Äù\n\nThey took him away. I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. I don‚Äôt know if he survived. But that incident left something in me shattered.\n\nWhat scares me is not that people don‚Äôt help. What scares me is that people are more afraid of getting involved than of watching someone die in front of them.\n\nWhat kind of society are we turning into?",

        "title": "Recent dowry deaths- My own story of dowry to all the young lovely women out there.",
        "selftext": "Happened 1 year ago,\n\nFor context: I was 28/F working as a Doctor of Stroke (Brain) in London earned 1 Crore per annum, pre tax with my locums and regular salary. Still owe the gov of uk 10 grand in taxes, which i have set up a payment plan with.\n\nSo one day, some random unknown distant relative from the same area as the recent Dowry death, UNinvited, came to visit my parent's office in AnnaNagar, Chennai.\n\nThey themselves asked to have tea, which my mom ordered. They announced to my mom and dad that they have a most wonderful boy for me marry within the relatives. They mentioned that this wonderful boy finished his UG 4 years ago and is at home preparing for ias. Honestly good for him, but no one in my family asked. They kept noting to my parents, that my parents have a girl, not a boy, and this boy family has their own big house and earn rental money monthly. The boy apparently has somehow seen me on instagram, which btw has only 12 posts, and somehow thought I am a great fit for him.\n\nThen they asked my mom what will my dad give as dowry.? So my mom just asked what.? He said yes, 'When u keep a girl, you have to keep gold only right, you cant just keep flowers.?' Mom was shocked, dad was fighting urge to slap him just for his depiction of women, mom held dad's hands. Then this relative went on to say that I must quit job and come live with the boy in this small town. Also my dad 'must' take care of marriage expenses which should be like a 'festival' and buy some nice suv car.\n\nYou would imagine this is the end, but no. He noted that I dont have to be a stay-at-home housewife, as they are very generous and I can finish my morning house chores early and open a small tent outside the house and run it as a clinic and earn money, and support it to the boy's family, whilst he is 'studying' for his ias. Safe to say, the not-so-hot tea he was drinking, was thrown in his face. They cursed me and my parents. My mom answered to this man, that I rather be single and happy than be with such people.\n\nFollowing this, we suffered backlash from many of my relatives, stating this relative is only asking what is normal in the world. My parents handled it with grace, and any relatives attempting discussion on this incident/dowry were avoided.\n\nIt all ended well, because i was in love and now I am in line to get married to my love of my life ..!üíç‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nPs: Relatives still are vile and toxic about my wedding. I find it appalling that they would rather I marry this guy from the story than the love of my life (also a doctor in uk)\n\nThankfully I got lucky with my mom and dad, but even if not, I would have just not consented to dowry weddings. The only reason I could do that, was because I am earning my own money and I was educationally and financially independent to say no to everyone. This is my story.",

        "title": "Why Workers From Across India Are Going On A Strike Tomorrow?",
        "selftext": "On 9 July 2025, workers from across India will go on a nationwide general strike. The strike has been called by the Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions against the four labour codes ‚Äî Code on Wages, 2019; the Industrial Relations Code, 2020; the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020; and the Code on Social Security, 2020 ‚Äî brought by the Modi Government.\n\nThe four labour codes on wages, social security, occupational safety and industrial relations, allows for dilution of workers' rights, including restricting the right to strike, weakening workplace safety, allowing hire-and-fire policy, and increasing the work-hours from the 8-hour work-day.\n\nWhen faced with criticism over the new labour codes, the Government claimed that the new labour code would allow a 4-day work-week. But with a caveat. The per-day work-hours would be increased from 8 hours to 12 hours. This is a deceit. The demand for a 4-day work-week entails an 32-hour work-week, not increasing daily work-hours.\n\nThe four labour codes were brought without any discussion with the labour unions, who have fiercely criticised the new codes. The Modi Government has not held the Indian Labour Conference in a decade, depriving the workers of a platform for negotiation.\n\nThe ITUC Global Rights Index has categorized India as a nation with no guarantee of rights, with repressive action against workers, violation of the right to strike and civil liberties.\n\nAccording to the 2025 Economic Survey of India, the wages of salaried men declined by 6.4% while the wages of salaried women declined by 12.5% over the last six years. Among the self-employed men and women, the decline was 9% and 32% respectively. At the same time, the quality of jobs has also seen a decline, with regular jobs declining by from 22.8% to 21.7%. Meanwhile, the profits of corporations reached a 15-year-high in 2023-24.\n\nThe national floor level minimum wages in India lie at a meagre ‚Çπ178 per day, practically unchanged for the last seven years. Meanwhile, the budget for rural employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGS) has been repeatedly slashed, leading to pending wages and suppression of work. Against the right of 100 days of guaranteed work, average workdays have declined to only 44 days.\n\nPublic sector jobs are being privatized. Regular wage jobs are being casualised. Unpaid labour is on a rise. With a rise of an unregulated gig economy, the workers are faced with exploitation, with no fixed working hours or employee benefits. Most of these corporations do not even have a minimum-wage policy.\n\nPrivate sector employees are pushed to work more, for fewer wages, and no rights. In highly profitable IT companies, the entry salary has been stagnant for a decade, whereas the CEO salary has risen by 100 times.\n\nIndia is among the most overworked nations. The death of 26-year-old Anna Sebastian Perayil, a chartered accountant at Ernst & Young accounting firm, has revealed the dystopian reality of exploitation of workers in India.\n\nMeanwhile, calls from rich industrialists, to increase working hours to 90-hours work-week have raised serious concerns about the labour welfare in India. Many states have proposed increasing work-hours to 10 to 12 hours per day.\n\nIt is important to remember that the workers and unions had to fight a long struggle for the rights we enjoy today. The demand for 8-hour work-day was one of the key issues, which was secured after immense struggle and sacrifice. Today, all these rights are under an assault. A labour movement is necessary to prevent the exploitation of the working class.",

However, it turned into something truly disturbing!\n\nWhile we were taking pictures of ourselves and casually walking around, my friend noticed two men filming us. \nThese disgusting men had recorded over 30 videos of us and countless photos on three different phones. My friend caught on first, and I immediately hid my face with my umbrella. But to my horror, we later found out that they had  even made slow-motion videos of my behind!\n\nWhen we confronted them and told them to stop, they had the audacity to walk towards us with the camera still pointed at us. And as you‚Äôd expect, they gave us an excuse that they were just taking pictures of the monument! \n\nThankfully, our boyfriends were nearby and stepped in (they were with the tourist guide). Only then did they reluctantly agree to delete the content with us in it, which, by the way, was mostly close-ups of our faces,chests, and behinds! \nIt was disgusting and completely dehumanising.\n\nWhat‚Äôs even more upsetting is that we were not even wearing revealing clothes, the both of us were dressed in kurtis with dupattas. We especially had made an effort to go as early as possible (6 AM sharp) to avoid the crowd, thinking that would give us a safer experience. Clearly, we were wrong.\n\nAnd the worst part was that the security who apparently make people delete videos of them dancing there didn‚Äôt take any action against these vile creatures. \n\nOur guide told us to not ‚Äúcreate a scene‚Äù and we didn‚Äôt want to invite further trouble since we‚Äôre not locals. We were also returning home the same day, and filing a complaint felt too overwhelming given how shaken we already were (and how the security personnel reacted).\n\nBut this entire experience has left us shaken, angry, and deeply hurt. None of this ever happens where we come from.\n\nIdk why do people from mainland treat us like that. \"\n\n\nIndian men seriously need to fix their rotten, perverted mindsets. The way they stare, film, and harass women like it's their birthright is beyond disgusting. It doesn‚Äôt matter how we dress or behave ‚Äî they‚Äôll still find a way to sexualize, violate, and humiliate. It‚Äôs not \"culture\" or \"curiosity\" ‚Äî it‚Äôs sick, entitled behavior. The sheer audacity and filth in their mentality is horrifying. This country won‚Äôt be safe for women until this deeply rooted creepiness is called out and crushed.\n\n\n",

The stretch of the Inner Ring Road between Koramangala (after the Sony World junction) and the Domlur flyover is in urgent need of public sanitation facilities, especially public toilets.\n\nAs someone who has commuted on this route daily for the past four years, it‚Äôs disheartening to witness the increasing number of auto drivers, cab drivers, and delivery personnel relieving themselves along the Army compound wall. This happens at all hours ‚Äî morning, afternoon, and evening ‚Äî and is a consistent issue.\n\nWhile part of this may be due to lack of awareness, the more pressing issue is the lack of accessible facilities. Many of these workers operate without access to office spaces or nearby commercial buildings, leaving them with no practical alternatives.\n\nProviding a few well-maintained public toilets along this stretch could make a significant difference ‚Äî not only for hygiene and public decency but also as a basic amenity for those who serve the city tirelessly.\n\nI sincerely hope this post sparks some positive action from the concerned authorities.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

About five years ago, I moved to Bengaluru for work and I‚Äôll be honest, I came in with a lot of caution.\n\nBefore shifting, I kept hearing the usual:\n\n‚ÄúBengaluru traffic will drive you mad.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAutos and cab guys are a nightmare.‚Äù\n‚ÄúLocals don‚Äôt like outsiders, especially if you don‚Äôt speak Kannada.‚Äù\n\nBut in these five years, my actual experience has been the complete opposite.\n\nWhether I‚Äôve driven my own car or taken autos and cabs, I‚Äôve barely faced any issues. People have been respectful, fair, and often more helpful than I expected. I was prepared for hostility, but what I got was patience.\n\nWhat made the biggest difference, I think, is effort. I started learning Kannada just basic stuff, greetings, directions, small talk. Even when I mess it up, people appreciate it. They smile, they help, and they correct me kindly. It‚Äôs made me feel included, not alien.\n\nThis city feels like it mirrors what you bring to it. I never acted like a tourist or outsider I just tried to belong, and Bengaluru met me halfway.\n\nI know others may have had different experiences, and that‚Äôs fair. But personally, I‚Äôve felt nothing but welcomed. It makes me wonder is it possible that the city treats you how you treat the city?",

When I kept my bike near the pump, I told the guy to fill for 350,then he kept that pump thing in my bike as usual. He then unexpectedly touched me and did that praying thing. He then said, foot got touched sir that's why I did it. I was like, oh ok sorry.\n\nI was then about to check the reading. It was showing 100. I then asked him why is that showing 100, why didn't you set 0. He was like ok sir, and set it and then filled for 250. He said 100 is already filled sir.\n\nNow I understood what was happening, Because for that 100 I didn't even hear the sound which comes when petrol gets filled. I told him, no you didn't put 0 for that 100 rs. He said no sir its all filled.\n\nI was angry, Then another pump guy came and asked me what happened. I then asked him:\n\n1. Every pump guy shows 0 before filling, why didn't he do it?\n2. And why did he even fill for 100 when I asked for 350 directly?\n\nNow that guy said, just do 250 payment sir its ok.\n\nI felt like a chad when I left. Later I checked the gmaps reviews of the bunk and many people mentioned that they got scammed.\n\nNow this all might seem normal to some, but I just wanted to put out there the power of questioning and speaking up. I was ready to ask him to show the previous meter reading or cctv footage for proof.\n\nMany times we just blame ourselves like, \"Oh I must've been more careful, since I didn't check it, it's my fault, now I can't do anything but pay\".\n\nNo. You can always question if you have even this slightest of doubt. It's our right. I know, sometimes everything might not go well. But do give it a shot.\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: For everyone asking the bunk details : [https://maps.app.goo.gl/f1WfJyqyUKrTfTjcA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f1WfJyqyUKrTfTjcA)\n\nIts on Kalkere main road, Ramamurthy Nagar",

        "selftext": "Dear commuters, please follow basic etiquette while using Namma Metro. Let‚Äôs not turn it into Indian Railways. Be responsible and considerate.\n\nHere are a few simple, yet essential, etiquettes that make a big difference:\n\n1.¬†Keep the volume down - No one wants to hear your reels or music on speaker  \nAvoid playing music, reels, or videos on a speaker. Use earphones. Digital displays remind us to maintain silence; please follow them.\n\n2.¬†Give seats to those who need them.  \nOffer your seat to senior citizens, pregnant women, people with children, or anyone visibly in need. Don‚Äôt wait to be asked.\n\n3.¬†Respect reserved seating.  \nDo not sit in seats marked for senior citizens unless you're eligible. If you see them standing, get up without being told.\n\n4.¬†Queue and allow smooth movement - Rushing in just slows everyone down.  \nStand in line while boarding. Let passengers disembark first. Don‚Äôt crowd or block the doors.\n\n5.¬†No spitting or littering.  \nSpitting gutkha, pan, or chewing gum inside the train or at stations is unhygienic and punishable. Keep our metro clean.\n\n6.¬†Respect fellow passengers.  \nAvoid loud phone calls, shouting across seats, or disturbing conversations. Keep your voice low in public spaces.\n\n7.¬†No loud office talks or gossip.  \nRefrain from office discussions, gossip, or personal chats in a loud voice. Be aware of the shared space around you.\n\n8.¬†If someone requests silence, respect it - It‚Äôs not an insult, it‚Äôs a request.  \nIf a fellow passenger asks you to lower your volume or keep quiet, do it without argument. Let‚Äôs be considerate.\n\n9.¬†Students, please mind your language - F-bombs in a public space? Not cool.  \nAvoid using abusive words like the F-word loudly. Have group chats outside the metro, not during the ride.\n\nLet‚Äôs show that Bangalore knows how to be modern with manners. Small courtesies go a long way in keeping our metro system clean, calm, and considerate.\n\nPS: Please don‚Äôt scold me or call me an old-school uncle üòÖ. Just sharing what many of us quietly wish we could say out loud.",

        "selftext": "According to BBMP reports, Bangalore has about 1 crore voters out of its estimated 1.4 crore population. Average voter turnout in Bangalore is around 51% - 54%. That makes roughly 30% of Bangalore population. Now, the estimated population of Bangalore, most probably doesn't count migrant workers and other unregistered residents. That would bring the percentage further down.\n\nElections are no longer about popularity or majorities approval. They are well calculated, planned fights for parties. It is sad, but it is what it is. For a candidate to win in Bangalore, out of the 30% that would vote, with at least 5 popular candidates or parties, guess how much vote percentage is needed! Slightly above 6? And who are those 6% of Bangalore? And how much is required to be captured to make sure that a particular candidate is lost?\n\nI mean no offence when saying this, the worst Bangalore white collars would do is file an online petition or make a social media post. They are disconnected from the grass root population and live in a fancier reality. They wouldn't go to rallies on offers of food or clothes. They wouldn't put up posters or participate in door to door campaigns. Maybe donate to their parties, but there are always corporates and other entities who make up majority of the donors. Guess who does! \n\nAnd the cry for bike taxis is only in Bangalore. Not even in the nearby districts. Guess who is present in all of Karnataka? Guess how many nom Bangaloreans are worried about the state of Bangalore and the traffic problems there on a daily basis. Guess how many of them reads social media posts about it and goes through online petitions. And guess how many are 6% of Bangalore population compared to the overall population of Karnataka. Sunday mornings are good for fun math. I will leave it to you.\n\nOfcourse, the white collars pay income tax. That goes to the centre. And guess how much of it the state gets back as its share! All 5 southern states and Maharashtra for that matter. An average techie in Bangalore is essentially good only for the amount of money he/she spend out of his income. And the 200rs professional tax per month. What is the best way to make them spend money earned in Bangalore in Bangalore? By making the essentials cost more. And transport is something that makes top of the list. Having IT companies in Bangalore doesn't help it directly. It is about the business around them. Cab, hotels, pubs, real estate etc. \n\nWhy would people who doesn't vote and who doesn't do grass root level work for them, who doesn't spend as much as they can would matter to the government? I am not worried about the downvotes on unpopular opinion, but please try to understand the reality and think about what can you do to make your voice heard. ",

We accepted it and proceeded to pay. When we asked for a bill, the salesperson casually said it would be sent later. That was our first red flag.\n\nA couple of days passed and we still hadn‚Äôt received the bill. We raised a complaint and visited the store again. This time, another staff member printed the bill on the spot, and guess what? The bill had extra items (like a duffle bag and other products we never bought) added just to match the total amount we had paid. None of those items were with us. And the shoes had 40% discount applied‚Äîexactly what we should have gotten in the first place.\n\nWe escalated the issue to the store manager, and thankfully, the extra amount was refunded the next day. But it was a clear scam‚Äîmanipulating bills, hiding actual discounts, and adding fake items. Furthermore, that employee when caught, claimed that we had requested only for a 10% discount instead of the actual 40..I mean sure!!!\n\nWhat‚Äôs shocking is that this happened at such a well-known location like Brigade Road. Please be cautious if you're shopping there! Please insist on the bill immediately, and verify all listed items and discounts.\n\nStay safe, folks. ‚úåÔ∏è\n",

Luckily, he had the doors locked and the windows rolled up. As soon as the signal turned green, he sped off but they attempted to chase his car on foot for a bit.\n\nHe managed to get away safely, but this really shook me. It‚Äôs scary to think something like this can happen in the middle of a busy area.

At first, we ignored it thinking it was just spam, but it kept happening, and it started to feel *off*. I got suspicious and decided to dig a bit deeper.\n\nOut of curiosity, I typed my dad‚Äôs number into Google Chrome and to my absolute *shock*, it showed up on a public website. But it wasn‚Äôt just his number ‚Äî this site had **2,000 pages**, and each page listed **100 to 200 phone numbers**. That‚Äôs literally hundreds of thousands of people‚Äôs data, just sitting out there for anyone to see.\n\nWhat made it worse was that one of the files was titled something like *‚ÄúDoctors Data‚Äù*, which made me wonder how deep this goes ‚Äî medical professionals‚Äô numbers, possibly even sensitive info. This whole thing really disturbed me.\n\nI immediately wrote an email to Scribd (where the document was hosted), urging them to take it down ASAP because this clearly wasn‚Äôt shared with consent. I explained what I found, how I discovered my dad‚Äôs number, and the potential risks of this kind of exposure. I‚Äôm actually *proud* to say they responded quickly ‚Äî the document was taken down within a few hours.\n\nStill, I can‚Äôt stop thinking ‚Äî **how long was that file out there?** How many people used it with bad intentions? It really hit me how real and dangerous data leaks can be, especially with the recent talk about data breaches in India.\n\nIt‚Äôs wild to think I just stumbled upon this by Googling a number, but I‚Äôm glad I did something about it. If you or your family have been getting random calls lately, I suggest checking if your number‚Äôs floating around online. You never know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewogidt3f9cf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b95b1e51d6d32b9662d48d07d70dfd20bc98557\n\n",

Bloody nothing\n\nhonestly some of these politicians should be sent to the gulag for their crimes because what the actual fuck even is this system\n\nafter fighting a goddamn claustrophobic war for 90 minutes you finally land in the glorious (shithole) dadar station which looks worse than some wartorn countries in the middle east , shit , garbage and paan spitting is everywhere , this station is one of the biggest crimes of humanity and honestly people should be hung to death for this monstrosity, the weather of this city doesn't do any favors to the average person because they keep cutting the fucking trees turning this into a  greenhouse deathtrap\n\n  \nthe biggest irony being the fact that is that it is literally the start of South Bombay which is supposed to be the best part of the city \n\nI dont know what they are paying the cleaners of this city but I am sure they are busy napping somewhere because in my entire 8 months travelling here I've never seen this place fit for human existence , the moment you get out of there you are greeted with the worst hygiene ever , vegetable vendors selling their produce in dirt and shit , humid weather , no space to walk because every fucking corner has been inhabited by some street vendor , unhygienic serving of food , dirt and grime everywhere , its like the BMC has just given up on even trying to make it livable \n\nto all the corrupt politicians and BMC of this shit hole of a city\n\ndo one thing swipe everyone's goddamn credit card , eat all the fucking money you can till it starts leaking from your ass cheeks but make this city habitable for the average person , I see shit like this and think winston churchill was right when he said\n\n\"Power will go to the hands of rascals, rogues, freebooters; all Indian leaders will be of low calibre & men of straw. They will have sweet tongues and silly hearts. They will fight amongst themselves for power and India will be lost in political squabbles\"\n\nI don't give a fuck what your political leaning is but none of the politicians have done jackshit to improve this city period , a goddamn metro line takes decades to become functional\n\nto all the people who travel to dadar how do you cope and live with yourself after seeing the most vile and disgusting view that humanity has created , 5 days of the week\n\nurking , irritating , disgusting , pathetic are the least vile words I can use to describe the state of locals and train station of this city",

        "selftext": "Not a rant, just genuine appreciation.\n\nToday while driving on the Atal Setu, I saw something that could have easily ended in a tragedy. Three scooters, with 6 people total, all without helmets, were riding on the bridge ‚Äî despite two-wheelers being strictly banned on that route. And that too in heavy rain and strong crosswinds. I could literally feel my car shake from the wind, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine how risky it was for them on a two-wheeler.\n\nI spotted them near the start of the bridge and even took a quick video, thinking I‚Äôll show it to any cop at the other end ‚Äî just for the riders‚Äô own safety. They were riding slowly (around 40-50 km/h), while I was in a car and drove ahead.\n\nTo my surprise, as soon as I reached the end of the bridge, I saw a police vehicle parked in an unusual spot. I stopped and told them about the scooters coming up behind. But before I could finish, the officer interrupted me and said ‚Äî\n\n‚ÄúYes, we already know. Got the alert from the cameras. We‚Äôve been waiting here for the past 30 minutes just for them.‚Äù\n\nI was honestly amazed. The coordination, the camera alerts, and how they stationed themselves ‚Äî all on point. The response was super quick and showed how effective the system can be when it works.\n\nHowever, this got me thinking ‚Äî\nIn other situations, like thefts, assaults, or medical emergencies, we often hear complaints of the police arriving late. Why is there such a difference in response times? Is it because of a lack of real-time info? Prioritization of traffic enforcement over other crimes? Or just limited manpower?\n\nWould love to hear insights from others or even people who work in the force.",

        "selftext": "So this past weekend, I was traveling via metro and a dude took a picture of me, got out of the train and then creepily stood outside showing me the picture he took as the doors closed. \n\nI was obviously shaken up. Went to the metro police. I was expecting them to say, ‚Äúmadam iska kuch nahi kar sakte‚Äù, or comment on the fact that I was wearing shorts. Nothing of the sort happened. They immediately took it seriously. Took down my number and details. Told me they‚Äôll track the cameras and try to find the guy. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. They asked me if I wanted to lodge an FIR. I chose not to at the time as I was very freaked out and I was also alone. \n\nToday I got a call from the cops saying they‚Äôd caught the guy. The photo didn‚Äôt exist anymore cuz it was on Snapchat apparently but the guy had admitted to doing it as the whole thing was caught on camera. Since there was no proof both the cop and I agreed that an FIR won‚Äôt do any good anymore. But they assured me that women‚Äôs safety remains an utmost priority. \n\nGoes to say we have such low expectations from our public servants even actually doing their jobs is surprising to us. ",

She never hangs up from her side as well.\n\nits not the first time i am living alone, ive been living alone since past 6-7 years and i almost call her daily, and every time when the call has to hung up she never wants it to. she s always like ‚Äúhmm, theek hai‚Äù or nothing at all, not even an hmm. almost inaudible. thats just too cute. going home tomorrow. will meet her. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWould like to know what other people living away from homes talk with their moms in this daily update call..\n\nTL;DR - Whenever I hang up after talking to mom, she never use the word ‚Äúbye‚Äù, or hang up the call herself.

Firstly, anand vihar railway station has mostly trains connecting Bihar which means insane number of people just loitering around the station, so movement is already snail pace. So chances of getting delayed in picking up or dropping is definitely high. Considering most of the trains are always delayed too,  so the pick up time will definitely be random.\n\n\nSecondly, this is India, such insane parking charges means, now people are parking vehicle at the entry and exit of the station and waiting for passengers. \n\n\nSo it was really insane, early in the morning to pay additional 150 for 2 seconds and then as you as you exit the parking, you are stuck at the exit gate of the station for 20 mins. What's the point of all this? It's so frustrating. I feel we are only punished by our govts without being provided any actual usable infrastructure. ",

        "selftext": "My friend and I (we‚Äôre both from the Northeast) visited the Taj Mahal today and we had been looking forward to it since forever. However, it turned into something truly disturbing!\n\nWhile we were taking pictures of ourselves and casually walking around, my friend noticed two men filming us. \nThese disgusting men had recorded over 30 videos of us and countless photos on three different phones. My friend caught on first, and I immediately hid my face with my umbrella. But to my horror, we later found out that they had  even made slow-motion videos of my behind!\n\nWhen we confronted them and told them to stop, they had the audacity to walk towards us with the camera still pointed at us. And as you‚Äôd expect, they gave us an excuse that they were just taking pictures of the monument! \n\nThankfully, our boyfriends were nearby and stepped in (they were with the tourist guide). Only then did they reluctantly agree to delete the content with us in it, which, by the way, was mostly close-ups of our faces,chests, and behinds! \nIt was disgusting and completely dehumanising.\n\nWhat‚Äôs even more upsetting is that we were not even wearing revealing clothes, the both of us were dressed in kurtis with dupattas. We especially had made an effort to go as early as possible (6 AM sharp) to avoid the crowd, thinking that would give us a safer experience. Clearly, we were wrong.\n\nAnd the worst part was that the security who apparently make people delete videos of them dancing there didn‚Äôt take any action against these vile creatures. \n\nOur guide told us to not ‚Äúcreate a scene‚Äù and we didn‚Äôt want to invite further trouble since we‚Äôre not locals. We were also returning home the same day, and filing a complaint felt too overwhelming given how shaken we already were (and how the security personnel reacted).\n\nBut this entire experience has left us shaken, angry, and deeply hurt. None of this ever happens where we come from.\n\nI‚Äôm sharing this here with their pictures as we didn‚Äôt know what else to do, and we‚Äôre still processing it all. It‚Äôs truly horrifying to realise even after taking all the precautions, we‚Äôre still made to feel unsafe just for existing. \n\nPs. The guy in the flannel shirt is the guide, he‚Äôs innocent.",

He is battling a critical condition called Interstitial Lung Disease, and¬†**his only chance at survival now is a lung transplant.**\n\nDivyansh is currently undergoing treatment at KIMS Hospitals, and doctors have clearly stated that the transplant must be done urgently.¬†**Watching my brother struggle to breathe, when every breath becomes a battle, is the most helpless and heartbreaking feeling for any sibling.**\n\nHe was once a bright, active young boy with dreams in his eyes and strength in his heart. But this illness has taken away his ability to live like a normal child. Now he lies in a hospital bed, weak and in pain, while we hold onto hope and prayers.\n\nThe total cost of his treatment, including surgery and post-transplant care, is ‚Çπ85,00,000 (around 100,000 USD). We have exhausted all our savings and taken loans, but we are still far from the required amount. We simply cannot afford such a huge expense on our own.\n\nAs a brother, I am doing everything I can to save my brother's life, but I cannot do it alone. This is my humble plea to you: please help us.Your donation, no matter how small, can give my brother and an artist a second chance at life. If you‚Äôre unable to contribute, please consider sharing this fundraiser with your family and friends. Every share, every prayer, every bit of support matters.\n\nWe are forever grateful for your kindness, compassion, and support during this incredibly difficult time.With folded hands and hope, [Please Donate](http://impactguru.com/s/fr2XZo)\n\nHarshit Verma\n\n(Brother of Divyansh Verma)\n\n",

Lip trembling like a child trying not to cry.\nAnd then... he did cry.\nNot from pain.\nFrom humiliation.\n\nA few nearby shopkeepers gave him some support. One of them said, \"Ye jo sabse zyada chillaya na, wahi sabse bada fattu tha.\"\n\nWe all agreed the road was congested. Mistakes happen. But what those guys did wasn't about the road.\n\nIt was about power.\nThe kind that bullies the poor because it knows it can get away with it.\n\nFinal thought:\n\nDelhi is becoming a city where hawkers and workers are blamed for jams which is somehow true but not entirely..\n\nWe need serious regulation for public space use not to punish hawkers.\n\nNo one should have to cry for simply trying to earn their daily bread",

That‚Äôs when a girl walked up to me and asked if she could borrow my phone to make a call.\n\nNow I don‚Äôt know about you, but I was instantly on alert. It felt off. I politely said no.

Same girl. Standing a little away from me, staring at me like I had done something wrong. Her eyes locked onto mine, and it wasn‚Äôt a normal glance. It felt... unsettling.\n\nI tried to ignore it. Told myself I was just being paranoid.\nCut to Rajiv Chowk. I get off to change the line and who do I see right behind me on the escalator?\n\nYep. The same girl.\n\nNow I‚Äôm genuinely freaked out. I tried walking faster, taking random turns, switching platforms and every time I glanced back, she was still there. Still following.\nShe even got onto the same metro as me going towards Dwarka.\n\nFinal stop. Dwarka Sector 21. She gets off there too.\n\nThankfully, I‚Äôd called my brother earlier to pick me up. He was already outside on the scooty. The moment I saw him, I ran, hopped on, and we zoomed out of there. Reached home safe, but my heart didn‚Äôt stop racing for hours.\n\nWhat was that? Has anyone else gone through something like this before?\nI don‚Äôt know if it was a scam attempt, something more sinister, or just coincidence but it scared me to my core.",

        "selftext": "\n\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm sitting in my car parked outside the hospital. It‚Äôs 3:30 AM, and I haven‚Äôt slept in almost 36 hours.\n\nOn Thursday, my father suffered a heart attack. I was at work when it happened, and no one informed me. When my shift ended, my sister casually called and asked me to meet her near AIIMS, saying we could grab something to eat. I didn‚Äôt suspect anything and agreed.\n\nWhen I got to the location, my brother-in-law arrived, took the wheel of my car, and as we drove toward the hospital, he finally told me what had happened. That moment broke me. My father had already been in the hospital for six hours, and no one had thought to tell me. I felt completely left out, like I didn‚Äôt matter in that moment ‚Äî and honestly, I‚Äôm still struggling to process it all.\n\nDespite the emotional toll, I tried to stay strong and support the situation as best I could.\n\nNow, nearly 36 hours later, I‚Äôve barely slept ‚Äî maybe an hour at most. I‚Äôm sitting here in the car, exhausted, overwhelmed, and feeling like I‚Äôve failed as a son. I keep thinking that my parents deserve better ‚Äî someone who makes them proud, who‚Äôs there for them. Ever since I started this 10-to-6 job, I barely spend any real time with my family.\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this, please ‚Äî don‚Äôt take your parents for granted. Take a moment today to hug them. Tell them you love them. Spend time with them while you still can. ",

The fuel switch moved to cutoff for both 1 second difference. Then they brought it back and 1 engine recovered by the height was too low. This is a deliberate action because if switch was not working it wont come back up. Also, there is no accidental movement that can cause to turn both switches off. One pilot asked to other why did they turn it off? They said they didn't. The pilot flying won't be able to do it cause you have to go a bit out of way to turn it off and their focus would be on flying. And if the copilot does it (not flying one), the flying pilot wont know until it is moved to cutoff post which the errors and warnings will light up on the dashboard. Also, if there was a possible issue with Boeing there would have been an advisory issued to check other planes by Boeing. Given that they have been flying for well over a decade and this hasn't occurred, doubt this is Boeing issue.",

The throttle module was replaced in 2019 and 2023.\n\nGreen highlights suggest: After the throttle module was replaced in 2023, due to the absence of Airworthiness Directives (AD), the inspections were NOT carried out. And since the inspections were not carried out, NO DEFECTS WERE REPORTED.\n\nAnd since no defects were reported, we do not know which defect crept up to impact the fuel control switch and/or the throttle module.\n\nWould the absence of AD led to a disaster waiting to happen? We do not know.\n\nAnd as other comments mentioned, this is quite early to speculate and confirm anything - manual sabotage or a defect.",

If you care enough to feed them, then at least get them vaccinated frequently and neuter them to prevent spreading of disease.\n\nThese animals too are carrying forward immunity against rabies if it's their 4th or 5th generation of being vaccinated.\n\nNeutering can help in reducing diseases drastically and regular vaccinations can ensure these strays don't get rabies by the bite of another rabies affected dog.\n\nFinally, people need to let go of rabid dogs and not defend them if they cannot take up responsibility for ensuring it won't harm anyone.\n\nMost of the time in society I've seen people defending rabid dogs charging at kids or disciplined pet dogs. What's the fault of kids and disciplined pet dogs? And then when you counter them, they just say it's normal behavior and he charges at everyone.\n\nBhai jab pata hai ki kutta kaat ta hai wo bhi unlogo ko jinko wo daily dekh raha hai, toh bhai maan lo na ki stray dogs galat hai aur authority ki gaadi bula kar usko check karwakar action lo ki euthanize karna hai rabies ki wajah se ya vaccinate karke training dena hai shelter mei lejakar..",

      "title": "New political contours in Tamil Nadu‚Äôs shifting sands",
      "text": "With its Assembly elections less than a year away, Tamil Nadu faces a pivotal moment in its pursuit of an upper-middle-income economy. Distinct historically, the State has long resisted national homogenising forces, forging its unique political and social identity. This trajectory is now being tested by complex economic challenges and an assertive central government. The years ahead will determine whether Tamil Nadu can sustain its equitable growth model and preserve its ideological moorings amidst new political realities. Tamil Nadu‚Äôs political landscape has long been defined by two distinct Dravidian strands. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), known for what political scientist Narendra Subramanian calls its ‚Äòassertive populism‚Äô, leveraged social justice and federalism to uplift marginalised groups. Despite criticisms of patronage, the DMK‚Äôs ideological commitment has been consistent.\n\nConversely, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) practised ‚Äòpaternalistic populism‚Äô, prioritising patronage and welfare over ideology. Led by charismatic figures such as M.G. Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK united diverse anti-DMK forces, from traditional upper-caste Congress supporters to landowning castes and welfare beneficiaries. It also mobilised Dalits against intermediate castes dominant in the DMK, forming a stable bipolar system, with the AIADMK as the DMK‚Äôs enduring adversary.\n\nThis bipolar Dravidian system, while fostering patronage and corruption, also drove a competitive populist economic model. This facilitated comprehensive industrialisation as well as welfare in health, education, and services. The State‚Äôs political exceptionalism has been crucial to its economic success, making it a beacon of inclusive growth, India‚Äôs second largest economy, and significantly reducing poverty.\n\nHowever, the Dravidian model has its limitations. Its competitive populism has delivered impressive quantitative outcomes such as good high school enrolment, extensive health care, and widespread industrial growth, but quality has often lagged. Learning outcomes are mediocre, employment quality needs improvement and unchecked industrial growth has degraded the environment. Critically, policies designed for the inclusivity of Other Backward Classes (OBC) may have reinforced caste divisions. Despite the State‚Äôs social justice rhetoric, there is persistent and deep-seated casteism with ongoing discrimination against Dalits and inter-caste tensions. The focus of the Dravidian parties on caste-based mobilisation, while politically successful, has often institutionalised rather than transcended caste identities.\n\nThe rise of the BJP\n\nThe national ascendancy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fundamentally disrupted this binary system. Lacking significant ideological traction in Tamil Nadu, the BJP has sought to carve out space for itself by fracturing the AIADMK‚Äôs traditional base, and fostering internal dissension and multiple splits. The irony is stark: a disarrayed AIADMK is now in alliance with the very force that is threatening its ideological and electoral space.\n\nThis opportunistic alliance now prioritises dislodging the DMK over ideological alignment. The AIADMK cynically leverages the BJP‚Äôs central strength: blaming the DMK government for failures in securing central funds or abolishing the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-UG despite the Centre‚Äôs refusal. More alarmingly, the AIADMK, under the leadership of Edappadi K. Palaniswami, a former Chief Minister, has now sought to use the BJP‚Äôs corrosive ideology as a crutch, seen in his criticism of the current government using temple funds to construct colleges.\n\nThe DMK‚Äôs strategy, in response, has been astute: forging a robust ideological alliance with the Congress, Left parties, and the Dalits-led Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) among others. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin‚Äôs accommodative leadership has maintained cohesion, with the perceived threat of BJP hegemony providing an ongoing ideological imperative. The coalition‚Äôs strong anti-BJP stance, crucial for cohesion, has also risked unfavourable central policies.\n\nThe strength of this alliance lies in its inherent framework of mutual accountability. The Congress ensures a national perspective while the Left parties ensure awareness of worker and peasant and environmental issues, pushing beyond narrow industrial progress. Crucially, the VCK‚Äôs presence represents a corrective mechanism to the DMK‚Äôs historical limitations ‚Äî anchoring the alliance to a comprehensive understanding of social justice that extends beyond OBC mobilisation to include Dalit recognition and upliftment ‚Äî seen in the alliance‚Äôs attempts at addressing caste discrimination and caste hierarchy more robustly.\n\nTamil Nadu‚Äôs active civil society further underpins the State‚Äôs ideological bedrock, championing a nuanced secularism. Unlike other States, where secularism can be defensive, Tamil Nadu‚Äôs communities often identify as Tamilians alongside their religious identities, fostering inter-religious bonds. Rationalist movements, film-makers and writers have created popular support for progressive policies that attack casteism, patriarchy, and superstition whilst enabling redistributive governance. However, this intellectual and social foundation now faces its greatest test as the political landscape fragments.\n\nFour-cornered contest, implications\n\nToday, Tamil Nadu faces a new four-cornered contest. The economic implications are profound. New charisma-driven forces have emerged. Actor Vijay‚Äôs Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) attempts to replicate the AIADMK‚Äôs matinee idol success with superficial Dravidian and social justice assertions. Conversely, film-maker Seeman‚Äôs Naam Tamilar Katchi seeks to redefine Tamil nationalism away from its Dravidian core.\n\nThis fragmentation threatens to exacerbate the existing limitations of the Dravidian model. The AIADMK-BJP alliance aims to exploit rather than resolve caste tensions. Parties such as the Pattali Makkal Katchi, mobilising specific caste identities, have aligned with the BJP for narrow identitarian gains. These formations offer little towards solutions for environmental degradation, gender discrimination or improving education and employment quality ‚Äî causes of concern in an otherwise developing State.\n\nThe DMK alliance‚Äôs progressive framework offers superior conditions for economic transformation. Its emphasis on secular outcomes and social amity creates the governance capacity needed for such transitions. This is aided by the internal dynamics of the alliance. This structure, despite contradictions, provides the best framework for evolving beyond the Dravidian model‚Äôs limitations while supporting social gains that are essential for economic progress.\n\nThe new fragmented political landscape could also affect the State‚Äôs economic trajectory. New battles rooted in casteism or communalism could threaten its ambitions. Social conflict approaches that pit community against community and propagate medieval communal values undermine this transition.\n\nAs the State seems to progress to an upper-middle-income economy, it must avoid the middle-income trap, shifting to an innovation-driven, high-value manufacturing model. This requires heavy investment in research and development, digital literacy, and diversifying exports into more higher-value products and services ‚Äî all of which demand greater state facilitation and fiscal autonomy.\n\nThe State contributed 11.9% to India‚Äôs manufacturing GDP and has the most factories nationally. Its manufacturing sector grew at 8.33% between 2021-22 and 2023-24. Yet, a significant impediment is the central government‚Äôs increasing fiscal centralisation and anti-federal policies. The Centre‚Äôs broader fiscal policies increasingly constrain Tamil Nadu‚Äôs financial autonomy even as the State demonstrates economic vitality with State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) collections growing 20.12% to ‚Çπ35,414.05 crore in H1 2024-25, reduced fiscal allocations post-GST and higher cesses continue to cut mandated devolution. More concerning is its refusal of development funds to Opposition-ruled States as a form of political pressure.\n\nRegional resistance to national relevance\n\nThese challenges highlight a broader strategic imperative for Tamil Nadu‚Äôs ruling alliance. Sustaining its distinct model requires moving beyond regionalism toward proactive coalition-building. As one State alone cannot effectively challenge central fiscal policies, coordinated opposition can create national pressure. Facing a hostile Centre, the DMK-led alliance must think beyond regional confines, mobilising opinion among other Opposition-ruled States on shared concerns: delimitation, a two-language policy, and greater fiscal decentralisation.\n\nEditorial | Undermining federalism: On central funding, States and education\n\nFor the alliance to achieve its aims within Tamil Nadu, its national partners ‚Äî particularly the Congress and Left ‚Äî must actively foster a favourable discourse on federalism, social justice and secularism nationally. The political battles in Tamil Nadu are thus not merely about retaining power. They are about preserving a distinct model of governance and development that has delivered tangible progress. The stakes for Tamil Nadu, Indian federalism, and its diverse ethos, could not be higher.\n\nsrinivasan.vr@thehindu.co.in",

      "title": "In Cuddalore, a tragedy on the tracks",
      "text": "Charumathy, 16 and Chezhiyan, 15, usually sat together in the school van. On the morning of July 8, as was routine, the siblings climbed into the van together, clutching their bags and water bottles. Their 55-year-old father, Dravidamani, stood in front of their house in Chinnakattusagai village and waved at them, says their aunt, S. Rani, 42.\n\nThe bright yellow vehicle belonged to the private school where the two of them had studied since lower kindergarten ‚Äî Krishnaswamy Vidyanikethan, located at S. Kumarapuram, in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu.\n\nA few minutes later, at 7:45 a.m., as the van ferrying the siblings and two other children ‚Äî V. Nimalesh, 12, and V. Viswesh, 16 ‚Äî tried to edge past a gated level crossing at Semmankuppam village, a passenger train barrelled into it. Charumathy and Nimalesh died on the spot, while Chezhiyan died by the time he was wheeled into the emergency and trauma care ward of the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, 44 kilometres from the site. V. Viswesh and the van driver, S. Sankar, 47, were rushed to the Cuddalore General Hospital. Doctors say their condition is stable.\n\nThe collision\n\nAmong the first few people to rush to the scene to rescue the children and van driver was P. Annadurai, 55, a resident of Semmankuppam. He says he heard wails and ran out of his house. ‚ÄúI looked out across my compound wall and saw the mangled remains of the van on the side of the track. The gate was open and I rushed out. When I tried to rescue the children, I came in contact with an overhead power cable and suffered some burn injuries,‚Äù he says.\n\nRangan, 50, an employee of a private company in Cuddalore SIPCOT, lives near the level crossing gate 170, a non-interlocked manned gate between Cuddalore and Alappakkam. He was getting ready for work when he heard a loud crash. Sensing that something was horribly wrong, he rushed to the level crossing and saw the mangled van.\n\n‚ÄúThe gate was open and the area was engulfed in smoke. I dialled the ambulance service and then went near the van. The van driver was bleeding profusely and I immediately carried him on my shoulders. There was one child inside the van. One child‚Äôs body had been dismembered. Another child‚Äôs body was lying near the tracks. Other locals attended to them,‚Äù he says.\n\nThe residents rushed Sankar and Viswesh in an ambulance to the Cuddalore General Hospital. Viswesh, a resident of Thondamanatham, lies on a bed in the emergency ward with an intravenous drip inserted into his wrist and a cast on his left arm. ‚ÄúI was travelling with my brother Nimalesh and two other students apart from the van driver,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúThe gate was open. There was no whistled warning from the approaching train. There was no signal either. The train hit our van as we were crossing the tracks. I was thrown out of the van. Everything happened in a flash.‚Äù\n\nThe Villupuram‚ÄìMayiladuthurai passenger train hit the vehicle with such force that it dragged the van for about 50 metres before coming to a halt. By then, the van had been reduced to a mangled heap. Eyewitnesses say they saw blood on the tracks and school bags, water bottles, and shoes strewn around the area.\n\nThe gatekeeper‚Äôs job\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the gatekeeper, Pankaj Sharma, had failed to close the gate when the train was passing. R. Sivanvel, a resident of Semmankuppam, a village near Cuddalore SIPCOT, says, ‚ÄúAnother express train had crossed the same gate about 20 minutes before this incident. The gate was open then too.‚Äù\n\nHe also says the train did not give any warning and came thundering down the tracks. The Divisional Railway Manager, M.S. Anbalagan, told the media that the train was travelling at 95 kilometres per hour.\n\nRangan says the van driver, Sankar, had been operating the school van for nearly 15 years and had taken the same route several times. He adds that more than 15 vans and buses belonging to various educational institutions in the vicinity pass through this level crossing daily.\n\nResidents of the area also allege that Sharma came out of his room only after they rushed to the accident spot. They contend that this was why an angry crowd pounced on him and manhandled him. Sharma has since been suspended and arrested.\n\nFollowing the usual route\n\nSouthern Railway officials say their preliminary inquiries revealed that the gate was closed when the van arrived. They say the van driver insisted that he be allowed to cross the gate so that he could quickly pick up more children and take them to school on time. ‚ÄúSharma allowed him to go through, which he should not have done,‚Äù says an official.\n\nA statement issued by the Chief Public Relations Officer, Southern Railway, said that it had sanctioned a fully funded underpass at the level crossing gate where the accident occurred. However, it alleged that the Cuddalore collector has not given permission for it in the past year. The collector, Sibi Adhithya Senthil Kumar, did not respond to phone requests for a comment.\n\nAnother Railway official says the road leading to the level crossing was curved. He believes that the trees on the side of the road may have obstructed Sankar‚Äôs view of the train. The trees mostly fall outside the boundary of the Railways. Workers were pressed into service to clear the trees the day after the accident.\n\nResidents say the driver of the school van took the usual route and tried to cross the tracks since the gate was open. The van had been fitted with speed governor and CCTVs but it had no attender to ensure the safety of the students.\n\n‚ÄúIf an attender had been present, he could have got down and checked both sides of the level crossing,‚Äù says an official from the School Education Department. ‚ÄúThere has been negligence on the part of the school administration, and the department has served a notice on the school seeking an explanation.‚Äù\n\nAn outdated system\n\nThe level crossing at Semmankuppam was a non-interlocked gate. This means that the gate‚Äôs position, whether open or closed, is not automatically linked to the status of signals and points, requiring manual operation and vigilance. There are at least two gatekeepers posted there and they work in shifts.\n\nA Railway official explains what happens when a train passes a non-interlocked level crossing. ‚ÄúNormally, the station master at a non-interlocked section communicates the details of an approaching train, along with a private number, to the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper then closes the gate and confirms this to the station master. The gatekeeper provides another private number, enabling the station master to allow the train into the block section. The private number is different for each train and is entered into a register maintained for the purpose. A private number that has been used can be used again only after 24 hours,‚Äù he says. In this incident, the station master was at Cuddalore station.\n\nHowever, in non-integrated level crossing gates, there is no mechanism for the station master to confirm the claim of the gatekeeper that the gate has been closed, he says. ‚ÄúIn this incident, they may have exchanged the private numbers, but the gatekeeper could have still failed to close the gate,‚Äù he says.\n\nAcross India, as of October 2024, there were 11,053 manned level crossing gates. Though all the level crossings were to be upgraded to interlocked gates in 2019, Southern Railway still operates trains through 276 non-interlocked gates, mostly in the Madurai and Tiruchi divisions. In Cuddalore, nearly 40 trains on average cross the Semmankuppam level crossing daily. ‚ÄúThe Railways should expedite the interlocking of gates on a priority basis,‚Äù says an official.\n\nAnother official speaks of the drawbacks of this outdated system. ‚ÄúThe non-interlocked system depends on verbal communication. If the gatekeeper says the gate is closed to road traffic, the station master takes that for granted and clears the train to run at sectional speed. The system is manual and runs on trust. On the other hand, at integrated level crossings, the gate is connected to the signalling system. The signal at the gate will turn red if the gate is open. The station master cannot clear a train to pass unless the gate is closed. And the gatekeeper cannot open the gate until the train passes,‚Äù he says.\n\nThere are other issues with the non-interlocking system as well, and these may not necessarily be the fault of the Railway. Officials say sometimes, people in a tearing hurry even assault gatekeepers for their delay in opening the gate. ‚ÄúOne such incident was reported in Mundiyampakkam level crossing in Villupuram district in 2008-09. A closed gate should not be opened at any cost. The locomotive of a train weighs nearly 100 tonnes. If the train had derailed at Semmankuppam, more casualties could have occurred,‚Äù an official says.\n\nOfficials say the records and statements of the station master, gatekeeper, loco pilot, and train manager will throw more light on the sequence of events that led to the tragedy.\n\nUnbearable grief\n\nLeaders of various political parties condoled the deaths. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin announced compensation of ‚Çπ5 lakh from the Chief Minister‚Äôs Relief Fund for the families of the deceased children, ‚Çπ1 lakh each for those severely injured, and ‚Çπ50,000 each for those with minor injuries. Southern Railway also announced ‚Çπ5 lakh compensation for the families of each of the deceased, ‚Çπ2.5 lakh for the kin of those grievously injured person, and ‚Çπ50,000 for other injured persons.\n\nMeanwhile, Dravidamani‚Äôs family is in shock, having lost both their children. Rani says Dravidamani, a farmer, had battled against all the odds to ensure that his two children were educated at a private English medium school. Charumathy and Chezhiyan shared a close bond. ‚ÄúEven after coming back from school, they would spend their time together. They rarely went out,‚Äù she says.\n\nShe adds that the siblings were similar in many ways: they were studious, intelligent, and ambitious. ‚ÄúCharumathy stood first in class and won many medals in school. She wanted to pursue an MBBS degree. Chezhiyan wanted to write the civil services exam and become an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer,‚Äù she says.\n\nRani adds the whole village is shocked by the tragedy and collectively pins the blame on the gatekeeper and the Railways.\n\nprasad.somasundaram@thehindu.co.in\n\nWith inputs from Vijay Kumar S.",

      "title": "View India‚Äôs Gender Gap Report ranking as a warning",
      "text": "India is now a global economic power, a digital innovator, and home to the world‚Äôs largest youth population. But the World Economic Forum‚Äôs Global Gender Gap Report (2025) is a sobering reminder that when it comes to gender equality, India remains far behind.\n\nStructural issues\n\nIndia ranks 131 out of 148 countries, with particularly low scores in economic participation and health and survival ‚Äî the pillars essential for meaningful gender parity. These are not just social indicators. They are signs of a structural failure holding back national progress.\n\nDespite progress in educational attainment, India continues to struggle in ensuring women‚Äôs health and autonomy. The report shows that India‚Äôs sex ratio at birth remains among the most skewed in the world, reflecting a persistent son preference. The healthy life expectancy for women is now lower than men‚Äôs.\n\nEditorial | ‚ÄãMind the gap: on India and the Global Gender Gap Index report\n\nSuch outcomes point to chronic neglect in reproductive health, preventive care and nutrition, especially for women from lower-income and rural backgrounds. Increased Budget allocations for health, especially at the primary care level, are a necessity to improve women‚Äôs well-being and their access to basic services, such as education and health care. Without good health, economic inclusion becomes impossible. Nearly 57% of Indian women in the 15 to 49 age group are anaemic ‚Äî as reported by National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 ‚Äî which reduces their ability to learn, work, or carry pregnancies safely. Such a widespread and correctable issue is emblematic of the broader failure to treat women‚Äôs health as a national development priority.\n\nIndia ranks 143rd on the Economic Participation and Opportunity subindex. Women continue to earn less than a third of what men do, and female labour force participation remains stubbornly low. The McKinsey Global Institute, in 2015, had projected that closing gender gaps could add $770 billion to India‚Äôs GDP by 2025. Yet, in 2025, India appears to have lost out on the opportunity. At the current pace of progress, it may take over a century to close the global economic gender gap ‚Äî and India lags behind even that trajectory.\n\nA sidelining\n\nThis is not just about employment numbers. Women remain busy in informal and subsistence work and are grossly under-represented in decision-making spaces ‚Äî from boardrooms to budget committees. The result is a policy ecosystem that repeatedly sidelines women‚Äôs lived realities. The burden of unpaid care work continues to be a major drag on women‚Äôs time and agency. Indian women perform nearly seven times more unpaid domestic work than men, as highlighted by the Time Use Survey. Yet, this critical labour remains invisible in national accounting and underfunded in public policy.\n\nInvesting in care infrastructure such as childcare centres, elder care services and maternity benefits would not only ease this burden but also enable millions of women to enter or re-enter the workforce. The vacuum in these services reflects both a gender and an economic blind spot.\n\nCentral and State governments must begin to account for unpaid care work in their economic and social policy frameworks through time-use surveys, gender budgeting, and direct investment in care infrastructure. India can look to countries such as Uruguay and South Korea, which have begun integrating care economies into their development plans, with positive results.\n\nSupporting senior citizens\n\nIndia is at a demographic turning point. While it continues to draw benefits from a young population, its percentage of senior citizens is expected to nearly double by 2050, reaching close to 20% of the population. This demographic shift will predominantly comprise very old women, especially widows, who often experience high dependency. At the same time, fertility rates have already fallen below replacement level, as noted in the NFHS-5. This means that the working-age population will shrink and the care needs of the elderly will rise. The only way to sustain economic growth in this context is to ensure women ‚Äî half the population ‚Äî are healthy, supported, and economically active. Gender equality is no longer just a rights issue. It is a demographic and economic necessity.\n\nIf women continue to exit or be excluded from the workforce, the dependency ratio will rise even faster, placing greater strain on fewer workers and undermining fiscal stability. Reversing this trend demands integrated policies that connect health, labour and social protection.\n\nIndia does not lack frameworks or ambition ‚Äî the slogans are there. What is required is real investment: in public health systems that prioritise women‚Äôs needs; in care services that redistribute unpaid work, and in policies that see women not as beneficiaries, but as builders of the economy.\n\nThe Global Gender Gap Report is not just a ranking. It is a warning: unless India treats gender equality as central to its economic and demographic future, it risks squandering the gains it has worked so hard to achieve.\n\nPoonam Muttreja is the Executive Director at Population Foundation of India.

      "title": "Sinner stands between Alcaraz and a three-peat",
      "text": "On his best days, Carlos Alcaraz treats his opponents like how a child handles a newly acquired toy. There is a testing phase, then there is a teasing and toying phase, before the whole thing is tossed out in search of a fresh, exciting challenge.\n\nFriday on Centre Court was one such day as the two-time defending Wimbledon champion outclassed Taylor Fritz 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6) to enter his third straight final at the All England Club.\n\nIt was the World No. 2‚Äôs 24th straight success, a streak that includes Roland-Garros, and now puts him in line for a second consecutive French Open-Wimbledon double, a feat last achieved by the legendary Bjorn Borg (1978, 79, 80).\n\nStanding in his way is World No.1 Jannik Sinner, whom he beat last month in Paris over five spectacular sets. The Italian got to the title round by handing 24-time Major winner Novak Djokovic ‚Äì who was physically sub-par ‚Äì a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 beat-down.\n\nIt was seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic‚Äôs first defeat before the final at SW19 since 2017, and only the second straight-sets loss in a completed match in southwest London after 2013.\n\n‚ÄúI could never imagine I‚Äôd play here in the final,‚Äù said Sinner, who has now reached the summit clash at every Slam. ‚ÄúIt shows I‚Äôm growing as a player. I struggled five years ago when I started on this surface. Now, I‚Äôm much better.‚Äù\n\nThis means Alcaraz has a mighty challenge on his hands and it is fair to say that he warmed up rather well against Fritz. The match was played at a frenetic pace ‚Äì just 2 hours and 49 minutes for four sets ‚Äì and witnessed some remarkable serving and outrageous shot-making.\n\nAlcaraz set the tone from the first point with a forehand drop-shot winner, and broke the American in a jiffy, and gave away precious little by taking the set 6-4 with an authoritative last hold that saw two big aces.\n\nIn the second stanza, Fritz‚Äôs return improved and he even managed a break-point in the eighth game only for it to be erased by a monstrous body serve. But at 5-6, Alcaraz was uncharacteristically broken to love, with two errors, a double fault and an imperious inside-out winner from Fritz doing the damage.\n\nBut the five-time Major titlist dusted it off to play his best set of the contest, winning 16 of his 17 service points. The two breaks of serve established his overall superiority over the 2024 US Open finalist as the third set lasted just a little over 30 minutes.\n\nHowever Fritz, despite staring down the barrel, did not throw in the towel, and there was thus an inevitability about the fourth-set tie-break. And fittingly, it emerged as a microcosm of the afternoon.\n\nAlcaraz jumped to a 4-1 lead only for Fritz to roar back to 6-4 and get two chances to drag the semifinal into a decider. But Alcaraz came up with two strokes of enormous depth before earning a match-point with a powerful pass that Fritz barely got the racquet to.\n\nThe 22-year-old then sealed it with a deep backhand to draw an error from the World No. 5 and set the stage for a fantastic three-peat",

      "title": "‚ÄãSilencing a sane voice: On U.S. sanctions against UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese",
      "text": "The U.S. decision to impose sanctions on a United Nations Special Rapporteur for her criticism of Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza has been called a ‚Äúdangerous precedent‚Äù by the UN and top UN Human Rights Council officials. The comments followed U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio‚Äôs announcement that Francesca Albanese, a ‚ÄúSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in occupied Palestinian Territories since 1967‚Äù, would face restrictions as a result of her engagement with the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has already been sanctioned by U.S. President Donald Trump in an executive order, shortly after he took office. While the scope of the sanctions are still unclear, they are understood to include travel and visa bans, and possible asset freezes for Ms. Albanese, who has drawn American ire with a report in June that urged international organisations to prosecute corporate entities and multinationals whose work helps fund the war. Ms. Albanese has frequently accused Israel of conducting the ‚Äúcruellest genocide‚Äù in Gaza, as well as its takeover of the Gaza Strip. She has also been calling for scrutiny of the ‚ÄúGaza Humanitarian Foundation‚Äù, a U.S.-Israeli NGO. The U.S. actions have no doubt been spurred by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs latest visit to Washington, where he announced that his government would nominate Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAmidst the rising death toll in Gaza and no ceasefire or deal for the return of Israeli hostages in sight, Washington‚Äôs focus on a UN official is absurd and outrageous. Ms. Albanese‚Äôs work is mandated by the UN Human Rights Council, and the U.S. actions undermine the global multilateral world order by calling those actions criminal. It is irrational to hold her responsible for the warrants and orders issued by the ICC and the International Court of Justice, which have heard testimonies from representatives of at least 40 states and international organisations on petitions calling for action against Israel. Mr. Rubio‚Äôs contention, that Ms. Albanese should be sanctioned for engaging with the ICC to prosecute U.S. and Israeli nationals ‚Äúwithout the consent of those two countries‚Äù, is not legally valid. Further, his allegations that she ‚Äúhas spewed unabashed antisemitism [and] expressed support for terrorism‚Äù are not borne out by facts. As global outrage over Israel‚Äôs killing of Palestinians, and the U.S. support for those actions, grows louder, as well as the BRICS summit condemnation this week, that India too joined, it is time for the U.S. to look in the mirror. The need is to effect an immediate ceasefire, and not in bringing the considerable might of the most powerful country to bear over one individual, in order to silence her voice.",

After that, I met her in a music video. She was an actor to me. I have worked with many actresses... She just came for the shooting of the music video, and then she left... We just gave her a good luck amount. The production of the video was unpaid. After that, we never contacted,‚Äù he said.\n\nMr. Haq refuted any involvement in Radhika‚Äôs death and expressed concern over attempts to give the incident a communal angle. ‚ÄúThis incident is being given a Hindu-Muslim angle too. I don‚Äôt know why it is being done. I don‚Äôt have to do anything with this case... Radhika has no social media. There is just a video clip on YouTube; that‚Äôs why it is being highlighted repeatedly,‚Äù he added.\n\nHe further said that false rumours about a relationship between him and Radhika are being spread on social media, which are completely ‚Äúuntrue.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was neither any kind of friendship nor any relationship between Radhika and me,‚Äù he said.\n\nMr. Haq mentioned that Radhika came to the shoot with her mother and had said her father liked the song.\n\n‚Äú...She (Radhika) came to the shooting (of the music video) with her mother. On the set, she also mentioned that her father liked the song, which means she took permission from her father also... When we met her for the first time, she told us that she wants to work in this line (film line)... She desired to work in this line... After that, we never met. We were in contact during the release of the song... She deactivated and reactivated her Instagram account around 2-3 times,‚Äù he said.\n\nMr. Haq also clarified that he hasn‚Äôt been contacted by police yet but is ready to cooperate.\n\n‚ÄúWhen the song did not get the expected popularity, I thought my song got wasted and I decided to delete it... I anticipated re-releasing it with another face. I was cast in the music video at the last moment as an actor, but I did not like my look. However, I am not deleting the video for now... I was not contacted (by any investigating officer). If I receive any call, I will definitely cooperate with them,‚Äù he said.\n\nRadhika Yadav, 25, was cremated in Haryana‚Äôs Gurugram on Friday (July 11, 2025). She was allegedly shot dead by her father, Mr. Deepak Yadav, following a disagreement over her tennis academy in Sector 57.\n\nDr. Deepak Mathur, who was part of the postmortem team, confirmed that multiple gunshot wounds. ‚ÄúThe postmortem of the deceased tennis player is completed. Four bullets were taken out from Radhika Yadav‚Äôs body,‚Äù Dr. Mathur said.\n\nPolice have arrested Mr. Deepak Yadav and placed him under one-day custody for further interrogation.\n\nAccording to Gurugram Police PRO Sandeep Kumar, the accused Mr. Deepak Yadav, who runs a rental property business, was unhappy with his daughter running the academy, insisting that their financially well-off status meant that she did not need to work.\n\n‚ÄúThe accused (Mr. Deepak Yadav) was unhappy with his daughter, Radhika, running her tennis academy and was asking her to shut the academy. The accused mentioned that they are financially prosperous people; therefore, he did not want Radhika to run any academy,‚Äù said Mr. Kumar.\n\nSources said that Radhika‚Äôs father had asked her to delete the video from her social media. Police are now examining the music video and other digital evidence as part of their investigation.",

      "text": "With delays in releasing seat matrices for several professional courses, the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) is considering conducting a preliminary counselling round to accommodate students who are certain about the undergraduate course they wish to pursue.\n\nSeat matrices for courses in engineering, veterinary sciences, agriculture, bachelor of physiotherapy, and allied health sciences have already been released. Option entry has been enabled for these streams, and students can now submit their preferences through the official KEA portal.\n\nHowever, seat matrices for other courses ‚Äî including medical, dental, Ayurveda, homeopathy, Unani, BSc nursing, architecture, and yoga & naturopathy ‚Äî are still awaiting approval from the respective departments.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nCompounding the delay, the KEA website continued to face technical issues, with the ‚Äòoption entry‚Äô portal displaying maintenance messages for the second day in a row on Friday. The time of resumption was revised throughout the day, leaving many students anxious.\n\nKEA executive director H Prasanna said a preliminary round is being considered for students who are firm about their choice of course. He explained that about 20 per cent of students fall into this category, and the idea is to conduct a round exclusively for them in which only Choice 1 will be enabled.\n\nIn the counselling process, once a seat is allotted, students can either accept the seat and confirm their admission, hold the seat and participate in the next round, give up the seat and continue the process, or exit from it entirely. The special round would be restricted to those who intend to immediately accept and join the allotted seat.\n\nWhile server-related issues are gradually stabilising, KEA has extended the ‚Äòoption entry‚Äô deadline from July 15 to July 18 to ensure candidates are not disadvantaged. Prasanna advised students not to panic and to use this additional time wisely. He urged them to prepare a rough list of their preferred colleges and courses with corresponding codes on paper before logging into the system. This, he said, would reduce the load on the portal by preventing prolonged logins and improve access for all users.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nKEA has stated that candidates will receive notifications once the ‚Äòoption entry‚Äô portal is fully operational again. Students have been asked to regularly check the official website for updates regarding the revised schedule for the first round of seat allotment. According to the latest announcement, the mock allotment results will be declared on July 21, and the final allotment results will be published on July 28.\n\nNEET-UG 2025 document verification from July 17\n\nCandidates who registered for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) or NEET-UG 2025 and paid the application fee after July 7, especially those claiming seats under categories from ‚ÄòA‚Äô to ‚ÄòO‚Äô and under the ‚ÄòZ‚Äô class, must appear in person for document verification at the KEA office in Bengaluru between July 17 and 19. This verification is mandatory for those seeking admission to medical, dental, Ayurveda, homeopathy, and Unani courses.\n\nSpecial category candidates, including differently abled applicants, and those under categories ‚ÄòA‚Äô to ‚ÄòO‚Äô and ‚ÄòZ‚Äô, must follow the document verification schedule published on the KEA website. The list of original documents required has already been made available during the Undergraduate Common Entrance Test (UGCET) process and must be carefully reviewed by the candidates.",

      "title": "The New Superman is less God, more human ‚Äî and lots of fun",
      "text": "Thirteen years from now, Superman will be 100 years old. Widely considered to be the first-ever comic book superhero, Superman spun out of the imagination of two Jewish immigrant boys: The writer-artist duo of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The story of an alien baby from the planet Krypton who crash lands onto earth, is raised by two humble farmer parents and goes onto become the protector of Earth while also masquerading as a mild mannered journalist resonated with millions in the form of comic strips, radio plays and television shows from 1938 till today. Superman has also made the leap from comic book panels to the silver screen multiple times, often embodying the fantasies and anxieties of the given time periods. Adding to this curious list of films is the newest attempt by director James Gunn and actor David Corenswet, simply titled ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù.\n\nSince there was no blueprint of a superhero when Superman was created, his personality and superpowers were more akin to those of gods and prophets from the pages of mythology and religious texts. Initially created as a stand-in for Moses, over the years in popular consciousness and even at the movies, his image morphed into that of a Christ-like figure. A purveyor of morality who would always put himself on the line to protect you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1978, when Christopher Reeve donned the blue suit, red trunks, and cape to play the Kryptonian, the United States was reeling from the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, and the masses were looking for a symbol to restore their faith in America. Despite being framed as lighthearted adventures, Superman: The Movie (1978) and Superman II (1980) had underlying themes of nuclear threats, cold war, and an added emphasis on American idealism and patriotism in tune with the country‚Äôs push towards Reaganism at the time.\n\n47 years later, Reeve remains the gold standard to play the big blue boy scout. His performance balanced heroism with humanity, and myth with vulnerability. James Gunn‚Äôs Superman preserves the Reeves model but gives it a refreshing spin. He‚Äôs still kind and gentle but has a bit of an edge to him. ‚ÄúBeing kind is punk rock,‚Äù he says at one point in the movie. I guess that‚Äôs the 2025 version of ‚ÄúTruth, Justice and the American way‚Äù.\n\nBut perhaps the version of Superman that Gunn‚Äôs film is in direct conversation with is the Zack Snyder version of the character played by Henry Cavill, whom we first met in 2013‚Äôs Man of Steel. If Reeves embodied the Christ-like humanity of the character, Cavill personified his torture and pathos. The ‚ÄòSnyder-verse‚Äô portrayed a rather bleak and serious world filled with superheroes who were as worn out by battling their inner demons as they were battling extraterrestrials. The colour scheme of Superman‚Äôs costume went from bright to dour. The emphasis was on perfect musculature of the physique, and Supes barely cracked a smile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the recent past, the pop culture landscape has been rife with portrayals of a ‚Äúdarker‚Äù take on Superman. For example, the character of Homelander from The Boys. In Snyder‚Äôs vision of a post 9/11 world, if people believed in a Superman, they were believing in a false god. Unburdening Superman and, by extension, his audience of this god-like baggage is probably the biggest achievement of the new film. It introduces the idea that ‚Äúmetahumans‚Äù or superpowered beings have been around for centuries. So Superman isn‚Äôt the most unique being with powers, but rather the best one of them all. He also has a posse of concerned robots that nurse him back to health, and a ferocious but cute pet dog by his side.\n\nThe film is also a bit overstuffed and tonally shaky, trying to be a lot of things at once. Some real-life parallels are attempted: A tech billionaire who is courting a world leader with flaxen hair, a subplot involving a militarily superior nation invading its neighbouring country, and a scathing joke about online trolls. Despite this, it nails the one aspect that had been missing from the big-screen Superman portrayals of the past few years ‚Äî it‚Äôs fun. Gunn may have finally given us a Superman that isn‚Äôt a cover version of Reeve, like Brandon Routh from Superman Returns (2006), nor a complete reinvention. This Superman takes the best bits from the previous incarnations, adding a dash of his own. But more importantly, we have a Superman who is less of a God, and more of a man.\n\nThe writer is a podcast producer and stand-up comedian",

It emerged from the grain of life ‚Äî how people worked, the elements they battled ‚Äî and it was watered and nourished by what they valued ‚Äî seasonings, spices and ingredients that were sometimes so prized that they led to wars of conquest, bloodshed, slavery and great explorations.

      "text": "Kangana Ranaut is accustomed to making headlines with her bold statements. This time, the actor shared her understanding of equality, acknowledging that it could lead to another controversy. In an interview with Times Now, she discussed her life as an MP, and her understanding of the social issues in the country. When asked about ‚Äòequality‚Äô, Kangana said, ‚ÄúYou are making me talk about controversial things, but I think, since the world has started to believe that we are all equal, we have only produced a generation of morons.‚Äù\n\nTo justify her statement, she pointed at the interviewer and said, ‚ÄúYou have so much more experience than me in this field. You are not equal to me when it comes to art. I am not equal to my mother. I am not equal to Ambani ji. He is not equal to me because I have four National Awards. Everybody is different. And we can learn from everybody.‚Äù\n\nShe further explained, ‚ÄúWhen I sit next to a labourer, I think this person has so much more tolerance than me. I am not equal to that person. A child is not equal to the woman, a woman is not equal to the man. A man is not equal to the elderly person in the family.

They don‚Äôt even have admiration for their bosses who may have 25 year experience in the same field. And the result is a generation of idiots, who don‚Äôt even want a promotion because they don‚Äôt want more work.‚Äù\n\nJust a couple of days ago, Kangana spoke about her helplessness in providing aid for her disaster-hit district, Mandi. She told ANI, ‚ÄúI do not have any funds for disaster relief or hold any cabinet post. MPs have work that was limited to Parliament. We are very small in the scheme of things. But, I can help to get disaster funds from the Centre.‚Äù This didn‚Äôt go down well, however, she reasserted her stance in an interview with India Today, ‚ÄúI told the reality to the people about what is in my hands and what is not. As an MP, we have to raise our concerns and bring funds. I have an ambit. I told the people that our party will fulfill all the people‚Äôs needs.‚Äù\n\nHer statement on equality stands in contrast to what she said in 2018 when she participated in a Q&A session at the Indian pavilion at the Cannes film festival, conducted by Prasoon Joshi.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nALSO READ | Ronit Roy opens up about daughter studying in University of Southern California, says son Agasthya is ‚Äòtoo bhola‚Äô for Bollywood\n\nSpeaking about equality in film industry, the actress shared, ‚ÄúEarlier discrimination between men and women was based on men being physically superior to women. Today, an actor and an actress do the same job. This has made people question, ‚ÄòIf they are working as equals, then why aren‚Äôt they getting the status of equals?‚Äô This has brought about a certain shift in the perspective of audiences.‚Äù\n\nIn a conversation with India Today, the actor had shared, ‚ÄúI have been talking about these issues for a long time, but no one took notice. It is a hopeless place. I have put everything at stake‚Äìfrom my career to my choices. I have two cases on me. I started the MeToo movement, which didn‚Äôt go anywhere. I fought for pay parity and rejected Khan, Kapoor, and Kumar films, but these women attacked me.‚Äù\n\nKangana Ranaut will be soon seen in a psychological thriller with her Tanu Weds Manu co-star R Madhavan.",

      "title": "Bhaskarjit Neog‚Äôs ‚ÄòWhat Responsibility, Whose Responsibility‚Äô analyses the philosophical grounds for ascribing moral agency to groups",
      "text": "Plutarch reports that the sophist Protagoras and the Statesman Pericles once spent a day discussing the cause of an accidental death of a passer by, killed by a javelin thrower at the Olympic Games. What or who killed him? The javelin, the thrower or the organisers, whose poor arrangement led to his death? Like a bullet, we aim to fix responsibility on the one who fired the gun not on the gun. But there are larger questions, touched upon in that ancient debate. What about the person who sold the gun, or the policies that allowed him to sell it? Questions of responsibility do not always stop at the level of individual actors; their instrumentality may be facilitated by organisational negligence.\n\nNegligence may be a responsibility bearing cause. Even here, the blame is fixed on some person(s), as in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. It is convenient, legally and morally, to blame an individual rather than an organisation, which lacks consciousness, often seen as necessary and sufficient to fix moral responsibility. The further up the causal chain, the more indiscernible and tenuous a singular cause.\n\nBhaskarjit Neog‚Äôs ‚ÄòWhat Responsibility? Whose Responsibility?‚Äô studies the philosophical grounds for ascribing moral agency to groups. He ‚Äúanalyses the moral culpability of collective entities implicated in institutional injustice, corporate scams, organised crimes, gang wars, genocide, xenophobia, and other group-based violence‚Äù.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nPhilosophers usually pin responsibility on the idea of free will: only conscious agents have the freedom to choose. There is no such thing (pace Rousseau and Durkheim or even Hegel) as a group mind. The sum of individuals is not a group. Even groups that are hierarchically organised are composed of individual actors, who may or may not be responsible for what one of them does, even if they are ‚Äòonly following orders‚Äô (a defence that did not work in Nuremberg).\n\nBut individual actions can often be understood only within a broader social context. Civil unrest, for instance, may enable individuals to take advantage of chaos or suffer its consequences. Were enough steps taken to prevent that protest from turning into a riot? If not, who is responsible? The moral/legal response is usually of the form ‚ÄòHeads must roll‚Äô, placing responsibility on the determinate actors.\n\nHere, Neog makes an interesting distinction between holding someone morally responsible and punishing them. The International Court of Justice can affix blame on countries, without having the teeth to take action against them. We may blame country A and its leaders for invading country B, without being able to punish them in any way. As one critic of collective responsibility said, ‚ÄòYou can only wave flags or write poems‚Äô.\n\nGranted that there are collectives (structured or unstructured), who is the bearer of collective responsibility? While some collectives like hospitals or municipalities can and have been held responsible for the actions of their employees, without being regarded as morally complicit, there are other cases, where groups or collectives are not easy to regard as agents. If a number of people are killed in a stampede, or drown in a flash flood, who can be held morally responsible?\n\nNeog argues that collectives can have both intentionality and agency and, therefore, have a sort of personal identity, even if its members change over time. A murderous crowd may add or lose individual members as it goes on a rampage but retains its identity and its collective intentions. Elias Canetti, in his classic work, ‚ÄòCrowds and Power‚Äô, describes what he calls‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúThe baiting crowd (which is like)‚Ä¶the hunting pack‚Ä¶it forms with reference to a quickly attainable goal. The goal is known and clearly marked and is also near. This crowd is out for killing and it knows whom it wants to kill. It heads for this goal with unique determination‚Ä¶ One important reason for the rapid growth of the baiting crowd is that there is no risk involved‚Ä¶ because (it has) immense superiority‚Ä¶ no one need fear the sanction attached to killing‚Ä¶ (the) permitted murder stands for all the murders people have to deny themselves for fear of the penalties for their perpetration.‚Äù\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThere are many questions, some of which Neog‚Äôs thought-provoking book raises about the conduct of and control exercised by, diverse collectives and how the actions of individuals can be attributed not merely to other individuals but the collective itself, which can be held morally responsible.\n\nFor those burdened with having to deal with corporate entities (banks, service providers, online platforms), the pursuit of individuals, who act on their behalf is often a Kafka-esque nightmare. Even when we know who to blame, we often need to cross the border that separates the instrument from the organisation that wields it and the even larger opaque structure ultimately responsible. More theoretical work needs to be done before we can answer the question of how such groups can be thought of as morally culpable agents and treated accordingly.\n\n(The writer is a retired professor at St. Stephen‚Äôs College)",

      "text": "The third Test between India and England, played at Lord‚Äôs in London, is hung in balance thanks to Jasprit Bumrah‚Äôs five-wicket haul in the first inning,s which helped India bundle out England for 387. This was Bumrah‚Äôs 15th Test five-wicket haul and, in the process, got his name on the Lord‚Äôs Honours Board for the first time in his career. His 5/74 in 27 overs included five maidens, and he broke Kapil Dev‚Äôs (12) record for most five-fors by an Indian in overseas Tests with his 13th five-wicket haul away from home.\n\nWhen Mohammed Siraj passed on the ball to Bumrah to celebrate his milestone, the Indian ace pacer had a muted celebration, which led to speculations about him being unhappy with the proceedings. Clearing all the air, Bumrah said he was too ‚Äòtired‚Äô to celebrate.",

The incident comes on the heels of an alleged gang rape at a law college in the city last month.\n\nThe police identified the accused as Parmanand Toppaunwar, a student who hails from Karnataka, and said that he will be produced at the Alipore court later on Saturday.\n\nAccording to police officials, the accused had called the woman, a student from another institute, to the institution‚Äôs campus for a counselling session. She alleged that when she arrived, he met her at the gate and asked her not to enter her name in the visitors‚Äô register. This raised some doubts in her mind, but she ignored them, she is learnt to have told the police.

She told the police that she fell unconscious and was raped, police officials said.\n\nThe woman claimed that after she regained consciousness, she escaped from the hostel room and informed a friend about the incident. Together, they approached the police, and an FIR was lodged at the jurisdictional police station under sections 64 (punishment for rape) and 123 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc.) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\nThe police suspect the involvement of four more individuals and have detained them for further questioning. While the security guard has been questioned, police sources said that they will be questioning the hostel superintendent and will check the CCTV footage.\n\nThe police have cordoned off the hostel room and collected forensic samples from the scene. Additional police force has been called in to increase security outside the institute.",

There are a lot of individuals, but when they have to defend, they know how to apply pressure. I think it will be a close match. Physically, they are very strong too.

      "text": "India is home to nearly 70% of the world‚Äôs wild tiger population, making it one of the best destinations for tiger safaris. The country boasts several biodiversity-rich national parks, where visitors can witness the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger in its natural habitat.\n\nFrom the dense forests of Madhya Pradesh to the mangroves of West Bengal, each park offers a unique wildlife experience. Here are the 10 best national parks in India for a thrilling tiger safari, along with their locations.\n\n1. Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand\n\nJim Corbett, established in 1936, is India‚Äôs first national park and is famous for its healthy population of Bengal tigers. Located in Uttarakhand, it features diverse landscapes ranging from grasslands to dense forests. Dhikala and Bijrani zones offer the best tiger sighting opportunities.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n2. Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan\n\nLocated in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, Ranthambore is known for its iconic landscapes, ancient ruins, and high tiger density.

      "text": "The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has seized Chinese firecrackers worth approximately Rs 35 crore, following a multi-port operation codenamed ‚ÄòOperation Fire Trail‚Äô, the agency said on Friday.\n\nThe action, based on specific intelligence inputs, led to the interception of seven containers at Nhava Sheva Port, Mundra Port, and the Kandla Special Economic Zone (SEZ).\n\nAccording to a statement by the DRI, the seized cargo weighing nearly 100 metric tonnes was illicitly imported in the name of a KASEZ unit and certain Import-Export Code (IEC) holders. The goods were falsely declared as ‚ÄòMini Decorative Plants‚Äô, ‚ÄòArtificial Flowers‚Äô, and ‚ÄòPlastic Mats‚Äô in an attempt to evade detection.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe press release noted that some of the consignments were routed through the Kandla SEZ with the intent of illegal diversion into the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA), in violation of the SEZ provisions. A key individual, identified as a partner of the SEZ unit, has been arrested for his role in the smuggling operation and remanded in judicial custody by the court.\n\nThe import of firecrackers is classified as ‚ÄòRestricted‚Äô under the ITC (HS) Classification of the Foreign Trade Policy and requires licences from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) under the Explosives Rules, 2008. The DRI pointed out that the smuggled firecrackers contained banned chemicals such as red lead, copper oxide, and lithium, which are hazardous to health and the environment.\n\n‚ÄúFirecrackers pose a significant risk to public safety, port infrastructure, and the broader logistics supply chain due to their highly combustible nature,‚Äù the DRI said in its statement, adding that the successful seizure prevented potential threats such as accidental explosions and disruptions in cargo handling operations.\n\n‚ÄúThis meticulously planned and seamlessly executed operation underscores DRI‚Äôs resolve to detect, deter, and dismantle illicit networks that undermine the Exim trade ecosystem and endanger public safety,‚Äù the release said.\n\nFurther investigations are underway.",

      "title": "How natural fasting windows, local superfoods kept our parents healthier than us: Here are eight ways to adapt them",
      "text": "So many times we are told that our parents and grandparents had robust health, that they never fell sick as frequently or that we didn‚Äôt see chronic illnesses in them. Were they truly healthier and fitter? Yes. Why? Because they kept it simple, doable and ended up being active. For us, there‚Äôs much to learn ‚Äî and reclaim.\n\nThere‚Äôs immense wisdom in how our parents lived and ate. Try adapting some of them.\n\nThe Simplicity of Their Meals: Food as Medicine\n\nOur parents ate fresh, home-cooked meals made from seasonal and local ingredients. Millets like jowar and bajra, native rice varieties and hand-pounded dals were staples.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nMeals were mostly home-cooked, using traditional fats like ghee, coconut oil and mustard oil ‚Äî far from the refined oils and seed oil blends of today. Pickles, papads, chutneys and buttermilk supported their digestion, not harmed it. They didn‚Äôt count calories ‚Äî they followed hunger cues.\n\nToday‚Äôs fast foods, preservative-laden convenience foods, meal replacements, protein bars and synthetic supplements and packaged meals lack this vitality, disrupting our digestion and health.\n\nTheir Relationship With Food Was Scientific\n\nThey followed natural fasting windows ‚Äî no late-night snacking or eating at odd hours. Dinner was often finished by sunset, not post-Netflix. In most households, lunch was the heaviest meal, aligning with the time when metabolism peaks and enzymes work best. Breakfast was light, dinner was even lighter and digestion was respected.\n\nToday, the trend is reversed: skipping breakfast, bingeing at dinner and eating in front of screens. The result? Sluggish digestion, toxin buildup (ama) and inflammation.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nMindful Eating, Not Mindless Munching\n\nThey sat down calmly, cross-legged, ate with their hands ‚Äî often in silence ‚Äî creating a deep connection between body and food. Touching food with the hands activates enzymes, salivary glands and builds awareness. Eating slowly allows the body to register fullness and helps better assimilation. Today, we eat distractedly ‚Äî on phones or in front of screens ‚Äî which disconnects us from satiety and causes overeating.\n\nSeasonal Wisdom and Local Superfoods\n\nOur parents naturally adjusted foods with the seasons: cooling foods in summer (buttermilk, mint, raw mango), warming in winter (jaggery, sesame, bajra) and easy-to-digest meals in monsoon (khichdi, ginger). Aligning your food to your geography and season builds immunity.\n\nMovement Was Built Into Life\n\nBefore gyms and 10,000-step trackers, our parents were naturally active. They moved all day ‚Äî squatting to cook, walking to the market, grinding spices by hand. This balanced their blood circulation and metabolism. Contrast this with our reality: hours in front of screens, sitting at desks, elevators over stairs and workouts squeezed into 30-minute windows ‚Äî often driven by aesthetics, not function.\n\nNatural Healing Over Medication\n\nOur parents didn‚Äôt pop a pill at the first sign of a headache or indigestion and in self-limiting conditions. They simply rested, kept their diet light. Today, we pathologize every symptom and depend on over-the-counter solutions.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nMental Agility and Emotional Resilience\n\nOur parents had stronger emotional immunity ‚Äî less anxiety, more adaptability. Their problems were real but their coping was more rooted. They were emotionally stronger ‚Äî not because they had fewer problems but because their lifestyles supported resilience.\n\nRespect for Rest\n\nSleep was sacred. They rose with the sun and slept early, in sync with the circadian rhythm. Today, we sacrifice sleep for screen time, leading to fatigue, hormone imbalance and burnout.\n\nWhile we can‚Äôt go back in time, we can move forward with awareness. Let‚Äôs not wait till disease strikes to value it.\n\n(Dr Mehta is holistic health expert)",

      "text": "At a time when flashy careers and high-risk trading often dominate conversations about wealth, a Reddit post is quietly shifting perspectives. Shared on the r/IndianStockMarket subreddit, the story of a man who retired at 45 with Rs 4.7 crore in savings‚Äìwithout a high-paying job, a business, or stock trading‚Äìhas struck a chord with netizens.\n\nThe post titled ‚ÄúHe retired at 45 with Rs 4.7 crore,‚Äù was shared by the man‚Äôs nephew, who credits his uncle‚Äôs financial success to nothing more than consistency and early investing. ‚ÄúThis was my uncle. Never had a flashy job, never built a business, never traded stocks. Just a boring job that paid decently,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nWhat made the difference was discipline. Back in 1998, when mutual funds were still a mystery to most people around him, the uncle began investing Rs 10,000, a significant amount at the time. Eventually, he started a Rs 500 SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) and steadily increased the amount as his income rose. ‚ÄúBy 2010, he was putting in Rs 20,000 a month. He never stopped,‚Äù the post read.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhen his nephew once asked how he‚Äôd pulled it off, the uncle didn‚Äôt offer a lecture‚Äìjust a CAMS statement and his bank passbook. The total: Rs 4.7 crore.\n\nBut perhaps what truly sets him apart is the way he has lived. No luxury apartment, no fancy cars, and only one vacation, Kerala. He‚Äôs lived in the same modest 2BHK for over 30 years and rode a scooter most of his life. Only now, in retirement, do they ‚Äî he and his wife ‚Äî travel more regularly‚Äì‚Äúalmost every weekend,‚Äù according to the post. Yet there‚Äôs still no showiness, just a quiet, contented freedom.\n\n‚ÄúKids have no idea about his net worth. He‚Äôs my go-to for anything practical in life. And honestly, he‚Äôs the only real inspiration I‚Äôve needed,‚Äù his nephew wrote.\n\nTake a look at the post here:\n\nScreenshot of the Reddit post Screenshot of the Reddit post\n\nThe post has received over 9,000 upvotes and sparked widespread admiration. Users hailed his story as proof that patience and simple financial habits can pay off in the long run. Others, while impressed, wondered whether such a frugal lifestyle came at the cost of enjoyment in his younger years.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nA user wrote, ‚ÄúI appreciate him saving money at an early stage, but not at the cost of compromising every stage of life. But good that he is free now and will be free rest of his life.‚Äù Another person commented, ‚ÄúHe wasted his life practically. Lived like a convict in a jail.

      "title": "Nasser Hussain slams India‚Äôs ‚Äòbizarre‚Äô ball change request, Jasprit Bumrah ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äô for Shubman Gill‚Äôs decision, feels Karthik",
      "text": "Former England captain Nasser Hussain slammed Shubman Gill and his team‚Äôs bizarre ball change request early on in the second day of play in the Lord‚Äôs Test on Friday, despite Jasprit Bumrah and the other pacers making the second ball talk move to their tunes.\n\nAfter bowling on 13 deliveries with the second new ball on the opening day, where Joe Root and captain Ben Stokes shored up the side past 250 for the loss of only four wickets, Bumrah made sharp rearrangements in the first session on Day 2. Bumrah knocked over Stokes with a sharp nip-backer before having centurion Root drag one back to the stumps and snipping Chris Woakes out first ball within a span of 12 deliveries in his spell.\n\nHaving taken the fresh Dukes at 80.1 overs overnight, Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj even troubled wicket-keeper Jamie Smith early on before he was dropped by KL Rahul in the slips. However, skipper Gill and Co. began raising pleas for a ball change around the 90th over before the umpires granted their request. But the Indians were left displeased by the quality of the red ball offered to them.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n‚ÄúThis is 10-over-old ball? Seriously?‚Äù Siraj was heard on the stump-mic, the nature of the ball even leaving the commentators perplexed.\n\nHowever, Hussain picked up on India‚Äôs odd request that eventually backfired. With Smith and seamer Brydon Carse slamming half-centuries, England moved up from a precarious 271 for seven by adding 116 more runs for the last three wickets.\n\nAbsolute nonsense from Nass. Ball was changed coz it was out of shape. And the ball after that was again changed because it was again out of shape. Reading the situation worse than Gabba 2002. pic.twitter.com/YXcNnyf8AU ‚Äî S (@reversepaddle) July 11, 2025\n\n‚ÄúIt was a very odd ball change from India. There‚Äôs two reasons you change a cricket ball. One is because the umpires think it‚Äôs gone out of shape, or two, because the bowling attack and the captain realise that the ball is doing nothing and you try and get the umpires to change it.\n\n‚ÄúThe ball was doing everything this morning. The ball they had, for 63 deliveries, was zipping round corners. Bumrah was going through a magic spell. Siraj at the other hand was having catches dropped. The ball was carrying through to the wicketkeeper. It was doing everything. It was doing more than at any stage in the Test match.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI cannot work out why you‚Äôd want to change a ball that was doing this much, sixty-three deliveries of the ball zipping round,‚Äù the former England skipper continued. ‚ÄúNot only did they want it changed, but the captain got really animated when they didn‚Äôt change it. I thought it was one of the most bizarre decisions.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a ball in your hand that‚Äôs doing a lot. We all know these Dukes balls are variable. He‚Äôs still on the umpire about the ball change. Now maybe he‚Äôs having a word with the umpires about, ‚Äòthis ball isn‚Äôt as good as the last one‚Äô. But that‚Äôs the problem with trying to change the ball, which is that if you‚Äôve got a good one, stick with it. I thought it was a really odd thing for a) India to do and then b) to get really animated and now c) to say, well, the ball we got is no good. Don‚Äôt change the good one.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòBumrah may not have been ready‚Äô\n\nSpeaking on the incident, former India wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik suggested that seam spearhead Bumrah, who eventually clocked his 15th Test five-for and a first at Lord‚Äôs, wasn‚Äôt prepared for his captain‚Äôs move to call for the ball change.\n\n‚ÄúA bit odd, considering how much that ball was moving, probably the most in this Test match and consistently as well. They delivered 63 balls with it and quite a few of them moved. So, I don‚Äôt know what the conversation was. It felt like [Mohammed] Siraj initiated that and Shubman was there, Bumrah looked like he wasn‚Äôt ready for it to be changed, but it happened,‚Äù said Karthik.",

      "title": "‚ÄòJasprit Bumrah challenges the best batters of the world‚Äô: Stuart Broad hails Indian pacer",
      "text": "With his 15th five-wicket haul during the second day of the India-England Third Test, Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah claimed his first five-wicket haul at Lord‚Äôs and got his name on the honours board at the legendary ground. It also meant that Bumrah broke former Indian captain Kapil Dev‚Äôs record of having the most five-fors by an Indian in overseas Tests.\n\nBumrah surpassed Dev‚Äôs record of 12 overseas five-fors with his 13th five-wicket haul in overseas Tests for India. Former Indian captain had achieved the feat in 66 Tests overseas, while Bumrah has claimed this in 35 overseas Tests. Former England pacer and their second highest wicket-keeper in Tests, Stuart Broad, has showered praise on Bumrah, terming him as a bowler who ‚Äòchallenges the best batters of the world‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄúTo be honest, that spell of getting Stokes (Ben), Root (Joe) and Woakes (Chris) summed up Jasprit Bumrah of what he does really. He challenges the best batters in the world. Left, right handers, brings all sort of dismissals, stumps and nick off into play. And it was amazing drama, amazing theater. It was wonderful. It was bit of swing, bit of carry. Few boundaries away but no one had settled. And then the one moving back down the hill to Stokes through the gate, Off stump out of the ground, was just you know Jasprit Bumrah can do that. And he really deserved to end up on that honours board,‚Äù Broad told Sky Sports.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhile Bumrah had taken the wicket of Harry Brook on the opening day of the Lord‚Äôs Test, the Indian pacer took the wickets of Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes in a seven-ball burst on the second day to leave England reduced to 271/7 from 251/4. The Indian pacer then has to wait for his fifth wicket for a while as India had asked for a change of the second new ball after bowling more than ten overs with it. The replaced ball saw England Batsmen Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse stitch together a partnership for 84 runs for the eighth wicket. The replaced ball again had to be replaced after some time and Broad was of the view that Bumrah would have got his first five-wicket haul at Lord‚Äôs much earlier in the day had Indian captain Shubman Gill not asked for the second new ball change after ten overs.\n\n‚ÄúI think he would have probably ended up on it a bit earlier if they had not changed the ball. The ball was swinging around, nipping and it went out of shape and they changed it. And you could tell immediately that Shubman Gill was frustrated with what happened. They given them a softer ball that what they were looking to change and it didn‚Äôt do as much from that moment. So Bumrah had to show a bit of patience to get the five,‚Äù Broad added.\n\nBumrah, who now has 215 wickets in 47 Tests with an average of 19.49 and best figures of 6/27, also matched former Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram‚Äôs record of 11 five-wicket hauls in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia) countries.\n\nThe Indian pacer talked about Friday‚Äôs five-wicket haul as a special one. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really special. We don‚Äôt come here (Lord‚Äôs very often, maybe every four years. You never know how many matches you‚Äôll get to play here. As a child, you see a lot of Test cricket played here. Being on the honours board feels good. I was excited to play at Lord‚Äôs.‚Äù Bumrah told BBC.",

      "text": "The AI talent raid seems to be intensifying. Google has now onboarded several key members from Windsurf, a startup that works on AI code generation. Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of Windsurf, has been brought in along with co-founder Douglas Chen and other senior research and development staff from the company.\n\nTalking about the latest development, Jeff Wang, Windsurf‚Äôs new interim CEO, said that most of the company‚Äôs world-class team will continue to build the Windsurf product with the goal of maximising its impact in the enterprise.\n\nWindsurf, which is among the fastest-growing startups in software development workflows, was on its way to being acquired by AI powerhouse OpenAI, and was in advanced talks until last month. Interestingly, Google is not acquiring the startup but is paying a whopping $2.4 billion for a nonexclusive licence for certain Windsurf technologies, essentially allowing the company to continue to licence its tools to others.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAfter the talent from Windsurf joined Google, a company spokesperson said in an email, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to welcome some top AI coding talent from Windsurf‚Äôs team to Google DeepMind to advance our work in agentic coding.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis took to X to express his excitement and welcome the new members.\n\nThrilled to welcome @windsurf_ai founders @_mohansolo & Douglas Chen and some of the brilliant Windsurf eng team to @GoogleDeepMind.

Great to have you on board! https://t.co/7LZ6MtO2p4 ‚Äî Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) July 11, 2025\n\nAccording to earlier reports by CNBC, OpenAI and Windsurf were in talks for an acquisition deal worth $3 billion. However, with the latest agreement, Google has veered ahead, further aggravating the ongoing talent war among big tech that are currently vying for top talents and leaders in AI and innovation to further their AI strategies.\n\nWho is Varun Mohan?\n\nThe former CEO of Windsurf, Mohan, is reportedly the child of immigrant parents from India who grew up in Sunnyvale, California. He attended the Harker School in San Jose, and as a student, he was known to demonstrate an aptitude for mathematics and computing Olympiads. Between 2014 and 2017, Mohan earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He later went on to obtain a master‚Äôs degree in engineering from MIT in 2017 with a focus on OS, algorithms, distributed computing, ML, and performance engineering.\n\nIn the formative years of his career, Mohan reportedly worked at top tech companies such as Nuro, Quora, LinkedIn, Databricks, Samsung, etc., accumulating a deep experience in software, systems, and engineering. Mohan has been widely recognised for his strong analytical skills and his ability to convert complex algorithms into production code.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn 2021, he co-founded the company Codeium, later renamed as Windsurf, along with his MIT classmate and long-time friend Douglas Chen. The company, initially, pursued GPU virtualisation infrastructure but later moved to IDE Plugin and standalone AI-native IDE. Reportedly, under Mohan‚Äôs leadership, Windsurf acquired over one million developers in just four months after its launch. The company raised $243 million, catapulting its net worth to $1.25 billion.\n\nMohan is among the first to push the agentic IDE concept that brought together large language models with agentic workflows like Cascade. He strongly believes that AI will handle most routine coding, allowing engineers to focus on problem identification, system design, etc.",

Her burial came days after her decomposed body was discovered in her Karachi apartment. The actor‚Äôs remains were found on Tuesday inside her rented fourth-floor flat in DHA‚Äôs Ittehad Commercial area when police arrived with a court-appointed bailiff to execute an eviction over unpaid rent.

This allegation led to widespread criticism on social media and prompted interventions from celebrities such as Yashma Gill and Sonya Hussyn, as well as offers of support from the Sindh culture department and the Sindh governor‚Äôs office. However, as reported by Arab News, on Thursday, Humaira‚Äôs brother, Naveed Asghar, arrived in Karachi and took custody of her body to transport it to Lahore for burial. Speaking to journalists, he denied claims that the family had abandoned her. ‚ÄúThe body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it,‚Äù he clarified.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistani actor Humaira Asghar, found dead on Tuesday, passed away nine months ago; brother to perform last rites after father refuses to claim body\n\nHe added, ‚ÄúAccording to the guidelines, we were (eventually) going to receive the body and perform the rites.‚Äù Naveed said that the family had been in touch with both the Chhipa Welfare Association and police, including Station House Officer Farooq Ahmed Sanjrani of Gizri Police, for the past three days. Naveed criticised media coverage that portrayed the family as indifferent, stating, ‚ÄúThe media‚Äôs focus was entirely on our family. It never highlighted other possible causes of death.‚Äù He explained the delay in claiming the body was due to procedural and emotional challenges. ‚ÄúDue to the condition of the body, we could not carry it at that moment,‚Äù he said, noting that the police were still completing legal formalities.\n\nHe also revealed that the family had recently experienced another loss. ‚ÄúMy parents were distressed due to the recent death of another close relative,‚Äù he shared, suggesting that this contributed to their delayed response. Addressing his sister‚Äôs isolated lifestyle, Naveed said, ‚ÄúShe moved to Karachi and had been living here for the last seven years‚Ä¶ she would visit home after several months or even a year at times.‚Äù He added that ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt contact us for a year, although our mother had reached out to her asking about her whereabouts.‚Äù\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHumaira‚Äôs mobile phone, he said, had been switched off for the last six months. ‚ÄúWe could not trace her number either,‚Äù he said. Her final known public activity was a fashion shoot in September 2024, around the time of her last Instagram post, dated September 30. Her WhatsApp messages also stopped being read in early October, with her stylist‚Äôs message on October 20 remaining unopened. Known for her presence on TikTok and Instagram, Humaira Asghar had once been a visible face in Pakistan‚Äôs entertainment and influencer circles. But in recent years, she had grown increasingly reclusive. Despite the polished public image she maintained online, she reportedly led a solitary life, with neighbors unaware of her fate for nearly a year. The apartment next to hers was unoccupied, and no complaints of odour were reported.",

      "title": "Hidden Stories: a Peshwa-era Pune temple that is looking to influencers for survival",
      "text": "Also by Kavyaa Masurkar\n\nA sculpture of three British soldiers near a chained rhinoceros serves as a reminder of the grim days of India‚Äôs colonisation, especially the Battle of Plassey in 1757 after which the British captured Bengal. Another sculpture points towards a little-known myth of Lingodbhava in which Shiva takes the form of a column of fire to resolve an argument between Vishnu and Brahma over who was superior. These stories, carved in stone, can be found in a surprising location ‚Äì the Shri Trishunda Ganpati Mandir in Somwar Peth.\n\nMulti-storeyed buildings tower over Shri Trishunda Ganpati Mandir on all sides, but like a timeless cave that it resembles, the temple effortlessly dominates the landscape. Made entirely of basalt rock and richly studded with sculptures, the temple was constructed between 1754 and 1770. Though Pune has undergone great changes over the centuries, the temple has stood the test of time.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nDevotees flock here for darshan every day but the temple also attracts a crowd that is curious over the late Peshwa-era architecture, the blend of Rajasthani, Malwa and South Indian elements in the entrance design and the intriguing carvings that connect with 250 years of history.\n\nA mahant‚Äôs vision\n\nThe Shri Trishunda Ganpati Mandir was the vision of Bhimjigiri Gosavi, a mahant from Dhampur near Indore who had moved to Pune. The chief deity is Trishund Mayureshwar Ganapati, i.e. Lord Ganesh with three trunks ‚Äì trishund ‚Äì and six arms, sitting astride a peacock. ‚ÄúWe believe the idol is from the Peshwa era, but there is no documentation for this or any information of when or how it arrived here,‚Äù says Harshad Vijay Barlal, a sevak of the temple trust.\n\nAnother unique feature of the temple is an underground chamber that contains the samadhi of Bhimjigiri Gosavi. Only once a year, on Guru Purnima, is this part of the temple opened to the public and queues form from the early hours. ‚ÄúThe disciples of Bhimjigiri Gosavi used to come on Guru Purnima to meet him, starting the tradition of the basement chamber being opened only on this day,‚Äù says Sachin Pawar, karyakarta of the temple and the Trishunda Ganapati Vijay Mandal Trust.\n\nAnother unique feature of the temple is an underground chamber that contains the samadhi of Bhimjigiri Gosavi. (Express Photo by Pavan Khengre) Another unique feature of the temple is an underground chamber that contains the samadhi of Bhimjigiri Gosavi. (Express Photo by Pavan Khengre)\n\nOn Guru Purnima this year, which fell on July 10, the temple received a record number of visitors. ‚ÄúThere were 75,000 to 1 lakh people who waited for five to six hours to enter,‚Äù says Pawar. The basement sanctum is accessed through narrow passage ways, halls, steep steps and a natural spring ‚Äì making the temple one of its kind in the city.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSignificantly, the temple contains two inscriptions in Sanskrit and one in Farsi, the former mentioning its construction period and the consecration of Lord Rameshar (Shiva) while the latter states that the temple is dedicated to Gurudev Dattatreya. It is at the temple that one can also find a sculpture of the mythical guardian creature, Gajasimha, who has the face of an elephant and the body of a lion.\n\nEfforts towards preservation and publicity\n\nLook closely, however, and you will notice the signs of age catching up with the temple. The elements have eroded the stonework in places, flattening or breaking the surfaces and several sculptures. ‚ÄúMaintenance is a challenge. The temple was built in a different era and needs special care. If we put marble or paint, we would be destroying its original aesthetics. But it needs treatment. We are making a project in consultation with historians and architecture experts. There are a number of new temples being constructed in India but, here we are, struggling to preserve this historic one,‚Äù says Pawar.\n\nThe committee has approached the Pune Municipal Corporation and the collector‚Äôs office, among others, for support. ‚ÄúAround 15-20 years ago, we realised that nobody was going to donate a large sum of money to the temple. We decided to make efforts to spread awareness about the temple. It was ironic that few people in Pune were aware of the Trishunda Ganapati Mandir, including people in our neighbourhood,‚Äù he says.\n\nThe karyakartas began to talk about the temple, creating word-of-mouth publicity. They distributed pamphlets in shops and public spaces. They made the most of the Internet. ‚ÄúSocial media has come as a boon. In the last five or six years, there have been many viral reels of the Trishunda Ganapati Mandir. These get lakhs of views. Suddenly, we are hearing about the Trishunda Ganapati Mandir from different people in different parts of the country,‚Äù says Pawar.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe crowds have increased. Influencer feeds are boosting the popularity of the temple. ‚ÄúOn Guru Purnima this year, I spoke to people who had come from villages and towns far outside Pune. The interest of the people gives us hope that the mandir that has lasted 250 years will be here for the next 250 years as well,‚Äù says Pawar.",

      "title": "Zohran Mamdani ‚Äî a threat to Wall Street and the US financial empire",
      "text": "Amidst the million hot takes about Zohran Mamdani‚Äôs victory in the Democratic Party primary for New York City‚Äôs mayoral race, two stood out. The first involved the undisputed don of the Democratic Party‚Äôs macroeconomic policymaking and former president Bill Clinton‚Äôs treasury secretary, Larry Summers, taking to X to berate Mamdani. Summers accused him of advocating ‚ÄúTrotskyite economic policies‚Ä¶ following the most problematic aspects of Britain‚Äôs Labour Party‚Äù and hoped that Mamdani would learn and eventually reassure Americans who are committed to a ‚Äúmarket economy as an American ideal‚Äù.\n\nThe second: A friend from Delhi posted a half-sarcastic story on Instagram that read, ‚ÄúCongratulations to all the residents of NYC‚Äù ‚Äî ribbing her fellow South Delhi folks for going gaga over Mamdani.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese disparate reactions highlight two fascinating trends evident in the aftermath of Mamdani‚Äôs primary win. First, the sudden burst of enthusiasm and hatred (in equal parts) around the world about Mamdani ‚Äî a name that most, perhaps, didn‚Äôt know until a month ago. Second, how rattled some sections of Wall Street and the larger mainstream American economic establishment and commentariat seem to be when thinking about the prospects of a Mamdani victory in November. On the face of it, the reasons for both are straightforward.\n\nNew York no longer boasts the world‚Äôs fanciest skyline; kids watching stray reels of Chongqing‚Äôs infrastructure in interior Uttar Pradesh and Bihar might testify to this fact. Yet New York, with its filthy subway and rat-dominated streets, remains enthroned as the world‚Äôs cultural capital. When a staunchly left-leaning politician rises in the city, it animates the global left and right in equal parts. This, at least on paper, explains the global fascination with Mamdani.\n\nFor Wall Street and the larger US economic mainstream, the idea of rent freezes and a wealth tax might be ones they are used to hearing in the American political discourse, but these need to be kept away from New York City, the heart of the global financial system. New York boasts the broadest, deepest, and most sophisticated financial markets in the world and accounts for a chunk of the US‚Äôs systemic global power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, these are just symptoms of a far more structural factor behind New York‚Äôs disproportionate role in the global imagination.\n\nAlso Read | For India to be a real player in the AI race, Parliament must step up\n\nThe late Italian economist and sociologist Giovanni Arrighi presents a masterful analysis in his book The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power and the Origins of Our Times, of how global financial centres like New York City have risen and fallen for centuries. More substantively, he contends that over the past six centuries, Genoa (the Italian city-state), Holland, Great Britain, and now the US have built capitalist global empires, which he refers to as ‚Äúregimes of accumulation‚Äù. These have had a few common features.\n\nFirst, each regime rests on a state-capitalist consensus, where economic sophistication arises from building world-class production and trade capabilities, supported by stable policies and institutions. This phase of development hinges on fixed capital investment driving productivity and mass consumption, seen clearly in early British and American dominance.\n\nSecond, when further investments in fixed capital begin to turn less productive and cause rigidities, the state-capitalist consensus facilitates the financialisation of the economy, which leads to a rapid financial expansion across the capitalist global empire. The Genoese made the switch in the 15th century. Around 1740, the Dutch withdrew from commerce and emerged as the bankers of Europe. The British also followed suit and, after accumulating heaps of capital during the Industrial Revolution, shifted to comprehensive financialisation centred around London. Similarly, the Americans, following the industrial success during the pre- and post-war period, shifted to rapid financialisation of their domestic and global economy by the mid-1960s.\n\nThird, while each cycle of capitalist accumulation shares core traits, they differ in institutional complexity and regime sophistication. Genoa monopolised commerce but relied on external security; the Dutch internalised defence costs. Britain industrialised and absorbed both production and security. The US went further, internalising global transaction costs through its unique financial markets. This marks a clear evolutionary arc from Genoa to Holland to Britain to the US.\n\nLastly, every phase of financialisation has carried with it seeds of the new regime of accumulation. A financial expansion has historically resulted in the flow of capital to another country, allowing it to develop production capacities more sophisticated than the incumbent, resulting in an increase in overall interstate competition and an eventual regime change. According to Arrighi, the shift from trade and production to financial expansion marks the beginning of the end of that regime of accumulation.\n\nAs a side note, these four factors would have been quite instructive in predicting the emergence of the US-China rivalry. After all, it was the rise of the US financial system and the flow of its capital and technology to China that eventually allowed Beijing to become a competitor. Albeit significant, it‚Äôs beyond the focus of our discussion.\n\nBy virtue of evolution, the US capitalist global era has produced the starkly financialised form of globalisation, where the losers and winners have never been as apparent. While the current US regime has internalised the greatest number of costs, it is also the one regime that has overlapped the most with actual democratisation. Therefore, over the past six centuries, no other empire has faced such high domestic political costs and discontents. This is precisely what has resulted in the American political system being swept away by politicians like Donald Trump and Mamdani.\n\nHow do these recurring patterns of global capitalist regimes explain the international obsession with Mamdani and Wall Street‚Äôs angst with him? This is because New York isn‚Äôt just the cultural capital of the world; it is effectively the capital of the US-led global financial empire. If the US created the widest and most comprehensive form of globalisation ever seen, then New York has been at the heart of it. In that sense, a small but significant upwardly mobile population across the world seems to be a part of New York‚Äôs fabric and its politics. On its part, the city obliges by ensuring even its local election campaign is flooded with foreign policy debates and developments across the world.\n\nFor folks on Wall Street and the like, Mamdani isn‚Äôt some run-of-the-mill social democrat. He at the very least poses a challenge to the capitalist class at the heart of the US economy. He isn‚Äôt just a threat to New York City but seemingly to the whole US global financial empire. Never mind that he might need some hard bargaining with Albany to fulfil his promises.\n\nThe writer is associate fellow, Observer Research Foundation",

      "text": "The 27-year-old Taylor Fritz failed in his bid to become the first American man since 2009 to reach Wimbledon final, but he knows why he couldn‚Äôt defeat Carlos Alcaraz ‚Äì his return of serve.\n\n‚ÄúI was not returning his first serve well at all. Part of that is because he served really well, like very well. Part of that is also because I know that I can‚Äôt just make the return because he will just drill the ball open court and then I will lose the point,‚Äù Fritz said after losing in four sets.\n\nIt‚Äôs as much his failing and a tribute to the insane pressure that Alcaraz puts on the opponents.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n‚ÄúI know I need to hit a good return if I want to be able to win the point, there is not much point of me blocking a return back and losing the point anyway. I could have maybe chipped a bit but I think that only works for a point or two, and then I think he starts to serve and volley me and he is incredibly comfortable doing that. I think that is something I need to get a lot better at is returning more aggressively.‚Äù\n\nThe drop shot followed by the lob üòÆ‚Äçüí® A bit of @carlosalcaraz wizardry ü™Ñ#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/DZKi1kYzHQ ‚Äî Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 11, 2025\n\nFritz admitted that Alcaraz‚Äôs game is so strong that a simple tweak here and there wouldn‚Äôt have helped. ‚Äú‚ÄúI think I return to put balls in the court, which is great for me against most people, because I can neutralise points but against him and Jannik [Sinner] might be the only guys, that if the return is not good their plus one is very dangerous.

      "title": "Guru",
      "content": "Guru ( Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å; IAST: guru) is a Sanskrit term for a \"mentor, guide, expert, or master\" of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, a guru is more than a teacher: traditionally, the guru is a reverential figure to the disciple (or shisya in Sanskrit, literally seeker [of knowledge or truth]) or student, with the guru serving as a \"counsellor, who helps mould values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student\". Whatever language it is written in, Judith Simmer-Brown says that a tantric spiritual text is often codified in an obscure twilight language so that it cannot be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher, the guru. A guru is also one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the guru has already realized.\nThe oldest references to the concept of guru are found in the earliest Vedic texts of Hinduism. The guru, and gurukula ‚Äì a school run by guru, were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE, and these helped compose and transmit the various Vedas, the Upanishads, texts of various schools of Hindu philosophy, and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts so also specific science and technology. By about mid 1st millennium CE, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of gurus existed in India, some near Hindu temples, where guru-shishya tradition helped preserve, create and transmit various fields of knowledge. These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures, Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.\nThe tradition of the guru is also found in Jainism, referring to a spiritual preceptor, a role typically served by a Jain ascetic. In Sikhism, the guru tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century, its founder is referred to as Guru Nanak, and its scripture as Guru Granth Sahib. The guru concept has thrived in VajrayƒÅna Buddhism, where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.\n\n\n== Definition and etymology ==\nThe word guru (Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å), a noun, connotes \"teacher\" in Sanskrit, but in ancient Indian traditions it has contextual meanings with significance beyond what teacher means in English. The guru is more than someone who teaches a specific type of knowledge, and included in the term's scope is someone who is also a \"counselor, a sort of parent of mind (Citta) and Self (Atman), who helps mold values (Yamas and Niyamas) and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.\" The word has the same meaning in other languages derived from or borrowing words from Sanskrit, such as Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Bengali, Gujarati and Nepali. The Malayalam term Acharyan or Asan is derived from the Sanskrit word Acharya.\nAs a noun the word means the imparter of knowledge (j√±ƒÅna; also Pali: √±ƒÅna). As an adjective, it means 'heavy,' or 'weighty,' in the sense of \"heavy with knowledge,\" heavy with spiritual wisdom, \"heavy with spiritual weight,\" \"heavy with the good qualities of scriptures and realization,\" or \"heavy with a wealth of knowledge.\" The word has its roots in the Sanskrit gri (to invoke, or to praise), and may have a connection to the word gur, meaning 'to raise, lift up, or to make an effort'.\nSanskrit guru is cognate with Latin gravis 'heavy; grave, weighty, serious' and Greek Œ≤Œ±œÅœçœÇ barus 'heavy'. All three derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *g ∑er…ô-, specifically from the zero-grade form *g ∑rÃ•…ô-.\n\n\n=== Darkness and light ===\n\nA popular etymological theory considers the term \"guru\" to be based on the syllables gu (‡§ó‡•Å) and ru (‡§∞‡•Å), which it claims stands for darkness and \"light that dispels it\", respectively. The guru is seen as the one who \"dispels the darkness of ignorance.\"\nReender Kranenborg disagrees, stating that darkness and light have nothing to do with the word guru. He describes this as a folk etymology.\nJoel Mlecko states, \"Gu means ignorance, and Ru means dispeller,\" with guru meaning the one who \"dispels ignorance, all kinds of ignorance\", ranging from spiritual to skills such as dancing, music, sports and others. Karen Pechilis states that, in the popular parlance, the \"dispeller of darkness, one who points the way\" definition for guru is common in the Indian tradition.\nIn Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion, Pierre Riffard makes a distinction between \"occult\" and \"scientific\" etymologies, citing as an example of the former the etymology of 'guru' in which the derivation is presented as gu (\"darkness\") and ru ('to push away'); the latter he exemplifies by \"guru\" with the meaning of 'heavy.'\n\n\n== In Hinduism ==\n\nThe Guru is an ancient and central figure in the traditions of Hinduism. Ultimate liberation or moksha and inner perfection is considered achievable in Hinduism with the help of a guru. The Guru can also serve as a teacher of skills, a counselor, one who helps in the realization of one's Self (Atma), who instills values and experiential knowledge, an exemplar, an inspiration and one who helps guide a student's (≈õi·π£ya) spiritual development. At a social and religious level, the Guru helps continue the religion and Hindu way of life. Guru thus has a historic, reverential and an important role in the Hindu culture.\n\n\n=== Scriptures ===\nThe word Guru is mentioned in the earliest layer of Vedic texts. The hymn 4.5.6 of Rigveda describes the guru as, \"the source and inspirer of the knowledge of the Self, the essence of reality,\" for one who seeks.\nIn chapter 4.4 within the Chandogya Upanishad, a guru is described as one whom one attains knowledge that matters, the insights that lead to Self-knowledge. Verse 1.2.8 of the Katha Upanisad declares the guru \"as indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge.\" In chapter 3 of Taittiriya Upanishad, human knowledge is described as that which connects the teacher and the student through the medium of exposition, just like a child is the connecting link between the father and the mother through the medium of procreation. In the Taittiriya Upanishad, the guru then urges a student to \"struggle, discover and experience the Truth, which is the source, stay and end of the universe.\"\nThe ancient tradition of reverence for the guru in Hindu scriptures is apparent in 6.23 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which equates the need of reverence and devotion for guru to be the same as for god,\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita also exemplifies the importance of a guru within Hinduism. Arjuna when faced with the realization of having to wage war with his kin is paralyzed with grief and remorse. Overwhelmed he lays down his weapons and refuses to fight. Despite his intellectual prowess and skill in warfare he finds himself lacking in Dharmic (moral) clarity. At this moment he turns to Krishna for guidance and in essence seeks Krishna as his guru. This interaction exemplifies the importance within the Hindu tradition for a disciple to seek guidance from an experienced spiritual guru. Additionally, other references to the role of a guru in the Bhagavad Gita include verse 4.34 - those who know their subject well are eager for good students, and the student can learn from such a guru through reverence, service, effort and the process of inquiry.\n\n\n=== Capabilities, role and methods for helping a student ===\n\nThe 8th century Hindu text Upadesasahasri of the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara discusses the role of the guru in assessing and guiding students. In Chapter 1, he states that teacher is the pilot as the student walks in the journey of knowledge, he is the raft as the student rows. The text describes the need, role and characteristics of a teacher, as follows,\n\nWhen the teacher finds from signs that knowledge has not been grasped or has been wrongly grasped by the student, he should remove the causes of non-comprehension in the student. This includes the student's past and present knowledge, want of previous knowledge of what constitutes subjects of discrimination and rules of reasoning, behavior such as unrestrained conduct and speech, courting popularity, vanity of his parentage, ethical flaws that are means contrary to those causes. The teacher must enjoin means in the student that are enjoined by the ≈öruti and Smrti, such as avoidance of anger, Yamas consisting of Ahimsa and others, also the rules of conduct that are not inconsistent with knowledge. He [teacher] should also thoroughly impress upon the student qualities like humility, which are the means to knowledge.\n\n \nThe teacher is one who is endowed with the power of furnishing arguments pro and con, of understanding questions [of the student], and remembers them. The teacher possesses tranquility, self-control, compassion and a desire to help others, who is versed in the ≈öruti texts (Vedas, Upanishads), and unattached to pleasures here and hereafter, knows the subject and is established in that knowledge. He is never a transgressor of the rules of conduct, devoid of weaknesses such as ostentation, pride, deceit, cunning, jugglery, jealousy, falsehood, egotism and attachment. The teacher's sole aim is to help others and a desire to impart the knowledge.\n\nAdi Shankara presents a series of examples wherein he asserts that the best way to guide a student is not to give immediate answers, but posit dialogue-driven questions that enable the student to discover and understand the answer.\n\n\n=== Reverence and Guru-Bhakti ===\nReverence for the guru is a fundamental principle in Hinduism, as illustrated in the Guru Gita by the following shloka \n\n‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§π‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡§É‡•§\n‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ‡•á ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É‡•§\nTransliteration: Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara,\nGuru Sakshat Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Gurave Namah.\n\nMeaning: This shloka praises the Guru, identifying them as the creator (Brahma), the preserver (Vishnu), and the destroyer (Shiva), ultimately recognizing the Guru as the supreme reality.Other notable examples of devotion to the guru within Hinduism include the religious festival of Guru Purnima.\n\n\n=== Gurukula and the guru-shishya tradition ===\n\nTraditionally, the Guru would live a simple married life, and accept shishya (student, Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø) where he lived. A person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula (the household of the Guru). The process of acceptance included proffering firewood and sometimes a gift to the guru, signifying that the student wants to live with, work and help the guru in maintaining the gurukul, and as an expression of a desire for education in return over several years. At the Gurukul, the working student would study the basic traditional vedic sciences and various practical skills-oriented shastras along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. The education stage of a youth with a guru was referred to as Brahmacharya, and in some parts of India this followed the Upanayana or Vidyarambha rites of passage.\nThe gurukul would be a hut in a forest, or it was, in some cases, a monastery, called a matha or ashram or sampradaya in different parts of India. Each ashram had a lineage of gurus, who would study and focus on certain schools of Hindu philosophy or trade, also known as the guru-shishya parampara (teacher-student tradition). This guru-driven tradition included arts such as sculpture, poetry and music.\nInscriptions from 4th century CE suggest the existence of gurukuls around Hindu temples, called Ghatikas or Mathas, where the Vedas were studied. In south India, 9th century Vedic schools attached to Hindu temples were called Calai or Salai, and these provided free boarding and lodging to students and scholars. Archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggests that ancient and medieval era gurukuls near Hindu temples offered wide range of studies, ranging from Hindu scriptures to Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.\nThe guru-shishya parampara, occurs where knowledge is passed down through succeeding generations. It is the traditional, residential form of education, where the Shishya remains and learns with his Guru as a family member.\n\n\n==== Gender and caste ====\nThe Hindu texts offer a conflicting view of whether access to guru and education was limited to men and to certain varna (castes). The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or varna. The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state that knowledge is for everyone, and offer examples of women and people from all segments of society who are guru and participated in vedic studies. The Upanishads assert that one's birth does not determine one's eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one's effort and sincerity matters.\nThe early Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras, such as Paraskara Grhyasutra, Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya smriti, state all four varnas are eligible to all fields of knowledge while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas, unavailable to Shudra and women. Kramrisch, Scharfe, and Mookerji state that the guru tradition and availability of education extended to all segments of ancient and medieval society. Lise McKean states the guru concept has been prevalent over the range of class and caste backgrounds, and the disciples a guru attracts come from both genders and a range of classes and castes. During the bhakti movement of Hinduism, which started in about mid 1st millennium CE, the gurus included women and members of all varna.\n\n\n=== Attributes ===\nThe Advayataraka Upanishad states that the true teacher is a master in the field of knowledge, well-versed in the Vedas, is free from envy, knows yoga, lives a simple life that of a yogi, has realized the knowledge of the Atman (Self). Some scriptures and gurus have warned against false teachers, and have recommended that the spiritual seeker test the guru before accepting him.  Swami Vivekananda said that there are many incompetent gurus, and that a true guru should understand the spirit of the scriptures, have a pure character and be free from sin, and should be selfless, without desire for money and fame.\nAccording to the Indologist Georg Feuerstein, in some traditions of Hinduism, when one reaches the state of Self-knowledge, one's own Self becomes the guru. In Tantra, states Feuerstein, the guru is the \"ferry who leads one across the ocean of existence.\" A true guru guides and counsels a student's spiritual development because, states Yoga-Bija, endless logic and grammar leads to confusion, and not contentment. However, various Hindu texts caution prudence and diligence in finding the right guru, and avoiding the wrong ones. For example, in Kula-Arnava text states the following guidance:\n\nA true guru is, asserts Kula-Arnava, one who lives the simple virtuous life he preaches, is stable and firm in his knowledge, master yogi with the knowledge of Self (Atma Gyaan) and Brahman (ultimate reality). The guru is one who initiates, transmits, guides, illuminates, debates and corrects a student in the journey of knowledge and of self-realization. The attribute of the successful guru is to help make the disciple into another guru, one who transcends him, and becomes a guru unto himself, driven by inner spirituality and principles.\n\n\n=== In modern Hinduism ===\n\nIn modern neo-Hinduism, Kranenborg states guru may refer to entirely different concepts, such as a spiritual advisor, or someone who performs traditional rituals outside a temple, or an enlightened master in the field of tantra or yoga or eastern arts who derives his authority from his experience, or a reference by a group of devotees of a sect to someone considered a god-like Avatar by the sect.\nThe tradition of reverence for guru continues in several denominations within modern Hinduism, but rather than being considered as a prophet, the guru is seen as a person who points the way to spirituality, oneness of being, and meaning in life.\n\n\n== In Buddhism ==\n\nIn some forms of Buddhism, states Rita Gross, the concept of Guru is of supreme importance. Guru is called as Garu in Pali. The Guru is the teacher, who teaches the spiritual and religious knowledge. Guru can be anyone who teach this knowledge and not generally need to be Acariya or Upajjhaya. Guru can also be a personal teacher. Buddha is called as Lokagaru, meaning \"the teacher of the world\".\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism's Tantric teachings, the rituals require the guidance of a guru. The guru is considered essential and to the Buddhist devotee, the guru is the \"enlightened teacher and ritual master\", states Stephen Berkwitz. The guru is known as the vajra guru (literally \"diamond guru\"). Initiations or ritual empowerments are necessary before the student is permitted to practice a particular tantra, in Vajrayana Buddhist sects found in Tibet and South Asia. The tantras state that the guru is equivalent to Buddha, states Berkwitz, and is a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.\n\nThe guru is the Buddha, the guru is the Dhamma, and the guru is the Sangha. The guru is the glorious Vajradhara, in this life only the guru is the means [to awakening]. Therefore, someone wishing to attain the state of Buddhahood should please the guru.\n\nThere are Four Kinds of Lama (Guru) or spiritual teacher (Tib. lama nampa shyi) in Tibetan Buddhism:\n\ngangzak gy√ºp√© lama ‚Äî the individual teacher who is the holder of the lineage\ngyalwa ka yi lama ‚Äî the teacher which is the word of the buddhas\nnangwa da yi lama ‚Äî the symbolic teacher of all appearances\nrigpa d√∂n gyi lama ‚Äî the absolute teacher, which is rigpa, the true nature of mind\nIn various Buddhist traditions, there are equivalent words for guru, which include Shastri (teacher), Kalyana Mitra (friendly guide, Pali: KalyƒÅ·πáa-mittatƒÅ), Acarya (master), and Vajra-Acarya (hierophant). The guru is literally understood as \"weighty\", states Alex Wayman, and it refers to the Buddhist tendency to increase the weight of canons and scriptures with their spiritual studies. In Mahayana Buddhism, a term for Buddha is Bhaisajya guru, which refers to \"medicine guru\", or \"a doctor who cures suffering with the medicine of his teachings\".\n\n\n== In Jainism ==\n\nGuru is the spiritual preceptor in Jainism, and typically a role served by Jain ascetics. The guru is one of three fundamental tattva (categories), the other two being dharma (teachings) and deva (divinity). The guru-tattva is what leads a lay person to the other two tattva. In some communities of the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara sect of Jainism, a traditional system of guru-disciple lineage exists.\nThe guru is revered in Jainism ritually with Guru-vandan or Guru-upashti, where respect and offerings are made to the guru, and the guru sprinkles a small amount of vaskep (a scented powder mixture of sandalwood, saffron, and camphor) on the devotee's head with a mantra or blessings.\n\n\n== In Sikhism ==\n\nIn Sikhism, seeking a Guru (Gurmukhi: ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡©Ç gur≈´) is of the utmost importance, Guru Nanak writes in Ang (‡®Ö‡©∞‡®ó):751 (‡©´‡©ß of the Guru Granth Sahib:‡®ó‡®æ‡®´‡®≤ ‡®ó‡®ø‡®Ü‡®® ‡®µ‡®ø‡®π‡©Ç‡®£‡®ø‡®Ü ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞ ‡®¨‡®ø‡®®‡©Å ‡®ó‡®ø‡®Ü‡®®‡©Å ‡®® ‡®≠‡®æ‡®≤‡®ø ‡®ú‡©Ä‡®â ‡••\nO foolish mind, without seeking a Guru, loving devotion with the Almighty is not possible.Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru says knowledge will have no foundation without a Guru\nThe Guru is the source of all knowledge which is Almighty. In Chaupai Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh states about who is the Guru:\n\nThe Sikh gurus were fundamental to the Sikh religion, however the concept in Sikhism differs from other usages. The Punjabi word Sikh derives from the Sanskrit word shishya, or disciple and is all about the relationship between the teacher and a student. The concept of Guru in Sikhism stands on two pillars i.e. Miri-Piri (‡®Æ‡©Ä‡®∞‡©Ä-‡®™‡©Ä‡®∞‡©Ä). 'Piri' means spiritual authority and 'Miri' means temporal authority. Traditionally, the concept of Guru is considered central in Sikhism, and its main scripture is prefixed as a Guru, called Guru Granth Sahib, the words therein called Gurbani.\n\n\n== In Western culture ==\nAs an alternative to established religions in the West, some people in Europe and the US looked to spiritual guides and gurus from India and other countries. Gurus from many denominations traveled to Western Europe and the US and established followings.\nIn particular during the 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the US. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially due to the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the US. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values.\nIn the Western world, the term is sometimes used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers' naivet√©, particularly in certain cults or groups in the fields of hippie, new religious movements, self-help, and tantra. It is also employed more generally for wellness gurus focused on alternative medicine.\nAccording to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), one of the reasons why in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the US then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demanding lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.\nSome gurus and the groups they lead attract opposition from the Anti-Cult Movement. According to Kranenborg (1984), Jesus Christ fits the Hindu definition and characteristics of a guru.\nEnvironmental activists are sometimes called \"gurus\" or \"prophets\" for embodying a moral or spiritual authority and gathering followers. Examples of environmental gurus are John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, George Perkins Marsh, and David Attenborough. Abidin et al. wrote that environmental gurus \"merge the boundaries\" between spiritual and scientific authority.\n\n\n=== Viewpoints ===\nGurus and the Guru-shishya tradition have been criticized and assessed by secular scholars, theologians, anti-cultists, skeptics, and religious philosophers.\nJiddu Krishnamurti, groomed to be a world spiritual teacher by the leadership of the Theosophical Society in the early part of the 20th century, publicly renounced this role in 1929 while also denouncing the concept of gurus, spiritual leaders, and teachers, advocating instead the unmediated and direct investigation of reality.\nU. G. Krishnamurti, [no relation to Jiddu], sometimes characterized as a spiritual anarchist, denied both the value of gurus and the existence of any related worthwhile teaching.\nDr. David C. Lane proposes a checklist consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have high standards of moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret the behavior of a spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are likely to be more unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.\nHighlighting what he sees as the difficulty in understanding the guru from Eastern tradition in Western society, Indologist Georg Feuerstein writes in the chapter Understanding the Guru in his book The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and practice: \"The traditional role of the guru, or spiritual teacher, is not widely understood in the West, even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship. [...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not even about morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this kind of message is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing\". In his Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of yoga to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.\nA British professor of psychiatry, Anthony Storr, states in his book, Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus, that he confines the word guru (translated by him as \"revered teacher\") to persons who have \"special knowledge\" who tell, referring to their special knowledge, how other people should lead their lives. He argues that gurus share common character traits (e.g. being loners) and that some suffer from a mild form of schizophrenia. He argues that gurus who are authoritarian, paranoid, eloquent, or who interfere in the private lives of their followers are the ones who are more likely to be unreliable and dangerous. Storr also refers to Eileen Barker's checklist to recognize false gurus. He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation, offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation. Storr's criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them, though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so. He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of psychosis to make sense of their own minds and perceptions, and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone. Storr notes that gurus generalize their experience to all people. Some of them believe that all humanity should accept their vision, while others teach that when the end of the world comes, only their followers will be saved, and the rest of the people will remain unredeemed. According to him, this ‚Ä≥apparently arrogant assumption‚Ä≥ is closely related and other characteristics of various gurus. Storr applies the term \"guru\" to figures as diverse as Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Gurdjieff, Rudolf Steiner, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Jim Jones and David Koresh. \nRob Preece, a psychotherapist and a practicing Buddhist, writes in The Noble Imperfection that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards. He writes that these potential hazards are the result of naivet√© amongst Westerners as to the nature of the guru/devotee relationship, as well as a consequence of a lack of understanding on the part of Eastern teachers as to the nature of Western psychology. Preece introduces the notion of transference to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes: \"In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves.\" In developing this concept, Preece writes that, when we transfer an inner quality onto another person, we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger: \"In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist, while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the archetype\".\nThe psychiatrist Alexander Deutsch performed a long-term observation of a small cult, called The Family (not to be confused with Family International), founded by an American guru called Baba or Jeff in New York in 1972, who showed increasingly schizophrenic behavior. Deutsch observed that this man's mostly Jewish followers interpreted the guru's pathological mood swings as expressions of different Hindu deities and interpreted his behavior as holy madness, and his cruel deeds as punishments that they had earned. After the guru dissolved the cult in 1976, his mental condition was confirmed by Jeff's retrospective accounts to an author.\nJan van der Lans (1933‚Äì2002), a professor of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, the distinction between the person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical personality cult.\nIn their 1993 book, The Guru Papers, authors Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer reject the guru-disciple tradition because of what they see as its structural defects. These defects include the authoritarian control of the guru over the disciple, which is in their view increased by the guru's encouragement of surrender to him. Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus are likely to be hypocrites because, in order to attract and maintain followers, gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus.\nAccording to the journalist Sacha Kester, in a 2003 article in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, finding a guru is a precarious matter, pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of Sathya Sai Baba whom Kester considers a swindler. In this article he also quotes the book Karma Cola describing that in this book a German economist tells author Gita Mehta, \"It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. Many of my friends have become crazy in India\". She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners do not believe in spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAmanda Lucia (2022), The contemporary guru field.

      "summary": "Guru ( Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å; IAST: guru) is a Sanskrit term for a \"mentor, guide, expert, or master\" of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, a guru is more than a teacher: traditionally, the guru is a reverential figure to the disciple (or shisya in Sanskrit, literally seeker [of knowledge or truth]) or student, with the guru serving as a \"counsellor, who helps mould values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student\". Whatever language it is written in, Judith Simmer-Brown says that a tantric spiritual text is often codified in an obscure twilight language so that it cannot be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher, the guru. A guru is also one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the guru has already realized.\nThe oldest references to the concept of guru are found in the earliest Vedic texts of Hinduism. The guru, and gurukula ‚Äì a school run by guru, were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE, and these helped compose and transmit the various Vedas, the Upanishads, texts of various schools of Hindu philosophy, and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts so also specific science and technology. By about mid 1st millennium CE, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of gurus existed in India, some near Hindu temples, where guru-shishya tradition helped preserve, create and transmit various fields of knowledge. These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures, Buddhist texts, grammar, philosophy, martial arts, music and painting.\nThe tradition of the guru is also found in Jainism, referring to a spiritual preceptor, a role typically served by a Jain ascetic. In Sikhism, the guru tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century, its founder is referred to as Guru Nanak, and its scripture as Guru Granth Sahib. The guru concept has thrived in VajrayƒÅna Buddhism, where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated.",

      "content": "AbhimƒÅna (Sanskrit:‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®) variously means ‚Äì pride, false prestige, desire, an impression, the conception, by self-conception, from the misconception; in Hindu philosophy, it means ‚Äì prideful attachment of \"I-sense\" i.e. man (to think) + mƒÅna (too much); it also means ‚Äì identify or identification and also refers to selfish conviction, for abhimƒÅna is the function of ahamkara (ego) as the state of mind which interprets experience as \" mine \".\nThe psychological sense of \"I\" am experience is ahamkƒÅra which comes about as and when owing to  avidya , Brahman, the Universal transcendental Self, is distinguished from the Jiva, the empirical individual self. Sanga (one's associations), mamkƒÅra (attachments) and moha (attractions) are the three aspects of abhimƒÅna (ego-consciousness) which produces katrtva (the sense agency) as the deliberate consciousness of ni≈õcaya (decision) without which there would be no difference between the self and other material objects;  buddhi  (intellect), which manifests according to vƒÅsanƒÅs (impressions), is deliberate decision.\n\nShankara tells us that the mind or manas dwells in the organs and body as aham (ego) with abhimƒÅna ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§® in the reflected brightness of the atman as the kartƒÅ (doer) and the bhoktƒÅ (enjoyer) experiencing all three states of consciousness but the atman, the witness of everything, limited by buddhi is not tainted by anything that buddhi does ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä for the taint of action attaches only to the actor, the ƒÅtman does not act. This abhimƒÅna or identification with names and forms dependent on the perishable body, as also with the subtle body, needs to be given up entirely in order to realize akhanda ƒÅnanda (inseparable bliss). VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra explains that it is ahamkƒÅra (empirical ego) which presides over the objects intuited by the sense-organs and then definitely perceived by the mind; and that the sense-organ intuits the object, manas reflects on it, ahamkƒÅra appropriates it and finally buddhi (intellect) resolves which way the intended action must proceed.\nAbhimƒÅna is the false sense of \"I\" and \"mine\"; it is because of the emphatic identity (abhimƒÅna) with one's body etc., that there is pramata (cognising subject) and involvement with pramƒÅnas (acts or processes of knowing, perception, inference and the rest) owing to functioning of the senses as resulting from avidyƒÅ (ignorance) and resulting in bondage. Examined from the level of social consciousness, ƒÅtman or the transcendental consciousness is certainly essential for man's being but upadhis (limitations) are its accidental parts the self-identification with which gives rise to abhimƒÅna (identification with the body) that makes man a socio-spiritual being subjective and objective, both, and becomes the basis for his adhikƒÅra (social and ritual eligibility). According to the Shudha Advaita school of Vallabha Acharya, saguna means ‚Äì one having the abhimƒÅna of gunas (forming part of one's own self), the nirguna is one having no abhimƒÅna.\nThe Lakshmi Tantra tells us that \"ahamkƒÅra which is a cognitive-sense, is identical with abhimƒÅna\" and \"the awareness of the knower in relating time and place to himself is called abhimƒÅna\". For most people desiring success, incidental gains and weighed down by sense of self-respect abhimƒÅna is a virtue but for those who are wise and contented, it is mere pride associated with arrogance. Bhoja, who outlined the theory of Rasa (experience of delight), attaches great importance to abhimƒÅna or ahankƒÅra (ego). He states that the rasika who has rasa in him has it because of sringara (peak), ahamkƒÅra and abhimƒÅna, enjoyable as a guna of his atman; he uses the term abhimƒÅna in a good sense. From ahamkƒÅra rises abhimƒÅna that originates sringƒÅra, and from abhimƒÅna rises rati (love, amorousness), and from rati are originated all rasas.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Areca nut production in India",
      "content": "Areca nut production in India is dominant in the coastal region within 400 kilometres (250 mi) from the coast line, and also in some other non-coastal states of India. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a tropical crop, is popularly known as betel nut, as its common usage in the country is for mastication with betel leaves. It is a palm tree species under the family of Arecaceae. It has commercial and economic importance not only in India but also in China and  Southeast Asia.\nAreca nut production in India is the largest in the world, as per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) statistics for 2017, accounting for 54.07% of its world output, and is exported to many countries.  Within India, as of 2013‚Äì14, Karnataka produces 62.69% of the crop followed by Kerala and Assam; all three states together account for 88.59% of its production. In the other states of Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, where it is also consumed, the crop is  grown in a very small area. In Karnataka, in the Uttara Kannada District and Shivamogga District the crop is grown extensively\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAreca nut is not a native crop of India. It is generally believed to be native to Malaysia or Philippines where it is grown in many varieties. It is a tropical crop which grows from West Indies to the East Coast of Africa, and in Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka and Malaya. The practice of chewing the areca nuts is attributed to Vietnam and Malaysia. It was from Southeast Asia that the crop spread to Asia and India where it is cultivated as a cash crop. It is conjectured that ancient Indian literature provide information on betel nut and its mastication. The Indian Ayurveda texts also refer to the areca nuts as a traditional medicine.\nIts use in India is also noted from the pre-vedic period and was described by the word taamboola in ancient Indian civilization. It is extensively used in  Hindu religious rites of birth, marriage, nuptial and is also offered to guests as a mark of hospitality. It is offered to gods in veneration in the form of taamboola, which consists of one areca nut placed over two betel leaves.\nAreca nut is extensively used as a masticator in south and southeast Asian counties, chewed with or without betel leaves. However, in India it has a special ethno-religious importance.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\nIn India there are two varieties of areca nut, also called supari in Hindi language. One is the white variety and the other is the red variety. The white areca nut is produced by harvesting the fully ripe nuts and then subjecting it to sun drying for about 2 months. In the red variety the green areca nut is harvested, boiled and then its exterior husk is removed. Sometimes Arecanut is even grounded in the soil for fermentation purpose to enhance the taste preferably called as \"Mojha Tamul\" in Assam.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn 1990‚Äì91 the area under areca nut plantation was 208,400 hectares (515,000 acres) and production was 249,300 tonnes. During 2013‚Äì14 its production was 729,810 tonnes from an area of 445,000 hectares (1,100,000 acres). In Karnataka, which leads the country in its production its production was  4,57,560 tonnes from an area of 218,010 hectares (538,700 acres). The details of state wise area and production are given in the Table for ten states.\nAreca nut, as a maritime species, is grown in areas of up to 400 kilometres (250 mi) inland from the coast of India at an elevation below 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). But its yield at higher elevations is not economical. Extreme climatic conditions, particularity of temperature, are not suitable for its growth; it thrives in areas with temperature range of 14‚Äì36 ¬∞C (57‚Äì97 ¬∞F). It also grows in areas in Kerala and West Bengal where the temperature varies from a minimum of 4 ¬∞C (39 ¬∞F) to a maximum of 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F). Good rainfall conditions are essential for its growth, say a well distributed annual rainfall of more than 2,250 millimetres (89 in). In well drained soils it can with stand rainfall of 4,000 millimetres (160 in) for its growth. Where the rainfall is less, as in the case of Tamil Nadu with incidence of rainfall of about 750 millimetres (30 in), irrigation facilities are mandatory. During the process of drying of the whole fruits or processed nuts sunshine requirement varies from 7 to 45 days.\nThe plant grows in well drained, deep clay loamy soil; laterite, red loam and alluvial soils are considered most suitable. Areca nut farming, to achieve good yield, needs large application of organic manures and chemical fertilizers.\nThe gestation period for the areca nut tree to yield fruits varies from four to eight years. Its life span is up to 60 years and in some cases even 100 years. Pollination takes place due to the effect of wind. The tree bears small creamy white flowers which have a strong scent. The fruit grows to a ripening stage in about 8 months. The tree bears bunches of fruits which are plucked manually.\nThe type of diseases affecting the areca nut plant are: bud-rot, mahali (fruit-rot), yellow leaf disease, which need to be tackled by chemical spraying.\nIrrigation is an essential requirement (once a week) along with the land drainage throughout the year. Irrigation water is drawn from rivers or wells using pump sets.\nThe chemical composition of areca nut comprises 14 to 15% of fat, polyphenols, tannins, alkaloids, polysaccharides, a small amount of protein, and vitamin B6 and vitamin C. The fat, which is extracted by using organic solvents, is made up of mastic acid and its byproducts. The fat is mixed in a certain proportion with cocoa butter or coconut oil, which is then used to make confectioneries and duplicate dairy products.\nThe polyphenol (tannins) content varies from 38 to 47% in tender nuts and 15 to 22% in ripe nuts. Tannin, which is extracted from the nut, is used in foods as natural colouring agent, and also in the leather industry. Other minor constituents in the areca nut alkaloids, in terms of the total weight of the nut, is about 1.6%, which are comprise arecoline, arecolodine, arecaidine, guvacine, isoguvacine, and govacolidine; the pharmacological and other uses of these alkaloids are as \"antihelminithic, ophthalmic, antibacterial, antidiabetic.\" \nAreca nut husk is used to make many industrial products such as hardboard, insulation wool, cushions, paper, paper board and activated carbon. The chemical composition of the areca husk consists of 18.75% furaldehyde which when distilled produces 5.5% furfural; it also yields xylitol.\nAreca leaf sheaths are used to make ply-boards. Other miscellaneous uses of leaf sheath are to make caps, eating bowls, vessels to keep palm wine, and artifacts. \nIn the past, plantation farmers practiced inter-cropping to make themselves safe economically, as the gestation period of the areca nut plant before it started yielding nuts was very long. It was also subject to plant diseases and pests.  Natural disasters and inaccessible locations also added to the problem. However, with improvements in management practices, with better marketing facilities and good infrastructure and cooperatives, inter cropping is less practiced.\nAreca nut cultivation is carried out according to farm management practices after studying different cost concepts. Costs include the value of hired human labour and hired and owned animal labour. As the nut is harvested five to six times in a year labour costs are high.\nThe areca nut tree grows as a single stem, and has generally a height of about 30 metres (98 ft). The fruit, which bears the nut, is orange coloured and is in the shape of an egg or oval shape; it holds a hard single seed.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nAreca nut and the plant as a whole is used widely in India and South Asia as: a masticator for chewing purposes, vegetable, medicine, stimulant, timber, fuel wood, clothing, wrapping, lubricant, tannin and so forth. The nut is chewed with the betel leaf as it has a stimulating effect.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGiriappa, S. (1 January 1994). Arecanut Production and Marketing in India.

      "title": "Arts and entertainment in India",
      "content": "Arts and architecture in India have been shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia, since ancient times. Arts refer to paintings, architecture, literature, music, dance, languages and cinema. In early India, most of the arts were derived Vedic influences. After the birth of contemporary Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of Islam spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe earliest production in the Indus Valley Civilization was characterised by cities and houses where religion did not seem to play an active role. The Buddhist period is primarily represented by three important building types- the Chaitya Hall (place of worship), the Vihara (monastery) and the Stupa (hemispherical mound for worship/ memory) - exemplified by the caves of Ajanta and Ellora and the monumental Sanchi Stupa. The Jaina temples are characterised by high levels of detail that can be seen in the Dilwara Temples in Mount Abu. Early beginnings of Hindu temple architecture have been traced to the remains at Aihole and Pattadakal in present-day Karnataka, and have Vedic altars and late Vedic temples as described by PƒÅ·πáini as models. Later, as more differentiation took place, the Dravidian/ Southern style and or the Indo-Aryan/ Northern/ Nagara style of temple architecture emerged as dominant modes, epitomized in productions such as the Brihadeeswara Temple, Thanjavur, and the Sun Temple, Konark.\nWith the arrival of Islam, a new style of architecture known as Indo-Islamic architecture emerged combining traditional Indian and Islamic elements. The earliest examples include the Qutb complex, a series of monuments built by successive sultans of the Delhi Sultanate. The architecture of the Mughal Empire includes the Red Fort, Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Humayun's tomb, Jama Masjid and Fatehpur Sikri.\nWith colonization, a new chapter began. Though the Dutch, Portuguese and the French were influencers, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed Indo-Saracenic architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements.\nWith the introduction of Modern Architecture into India and later with Independence, the quest was more towards progress as a paradigm fuelled by Nehruvian visions. The planning of Chandigarh- a city most architects hate/love- by Le Corbusier was considered a step towards this. Later as modernism became less popular in the West and new directions were sought for, there was a movement in India toward architecture rooted in the Indian context. This direction called Critical Regionalism is exemplified in the works of architects such as B. V. Doshi, Charles Correa, etc. Apart from this, the advent of globalisation and economic development since the 90s, has spawned a collection of modern IT campuses and skyscrapers, and as economic reform accelerates, metropolitan areas are gaining futuristic skylines.\n\nVarious examples of Indian architecture\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nIndian literature is generally acknowledged, but not wholly established, as the oldest in the world. India has 22 officially recognized languages, and a huge variety of literature has been produced in these languages over the years. In Indian literature, oral and written forms are both important. Hindu literary traditions dominate a large part of Indian culture. Apart from the Vedas which are a sacred form of knowledge, there are other works such as the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, treatises such as Vaastu Shastra in architecture and town planning, and Arthashastra in political science. Devotional Hindu drama, poetry and songs span the subcontinent. Among the best known are the works of Kalidasa (writer of the famed Sanskrit play Shakuntala) and Tulsidas (who wrote an epic Hindi poem based on the Ramayana, called Raamcharitmaanas).\nTamil literature has been in existence for more than 2500 years. Tolkaappiyam has been credited as its oldest work, whereas the exact origins of Thirukkural is unknown. The golden age of Tamil literature was during the Sangam period, roughly 1800 years ago. The classic works of this period are Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai, and Sivakasinthamani. Tamil literature is known for its secular traditions, although its authors had strong religious beliefs. Thirukkural is considered to be the greatest of Tamil works. Kannada literature is probably the third oldest in Indian literature next to Sanskrit literature and Tamil literature. The earliest reported work in Kannada literature dates back to the fifth century. The first available literary in Kannada is Kavirajamarga, written in the eighth century by Amoghavarsha Nrpatunga. Hindi literature started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like Avadhi and Brij. The most famous figures from this period are Kabir and Tulsidas. In modern times, the Khadi dialect became more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in Sanskrit.\nThe most renowned Bengali writer is Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature. In the last century, several Indian writers have distinguished themselves not only in traditional Indian languages but also in English. India's only native-born Nobel laureate in literature was the Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore, but VS Naipaul, a diaspora Indian novelist born in Trinidad, also won the Nobel in 2001. Other major writers who are either Indian or of Indian origin and derive much inspiration from Indian themes are R. K. Narayan, Vikram Seth, Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Raja Rao, Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Chandra, Mukul Kesavan, Shashi Tharoor, Nayantara Sehgal, Anita Desai, Ashok Banker, Shashi Deshpande, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Bharati Mukherjee.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nIndian music includes multiple varieties of folk, popular, pop, and classical music. India's classical music tradition, including Carnatic and Hindustani music, has a history spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of religious inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen ethnic groups, speaking their own languages and dialects. Alongside distinctly subcontinental forms there are major influences from Persian, Arab and British music. Indian genres like filmi and bhangra have become popular throughout the United Kingdom, South and East Asia, and around the world.\nIndian stars now sell records in many countries, while world music fans listen to the roots music of India's diverse nations. American soul, rock and hip hop music have also made a large impact, primarily on Indian pop and filmi music. Other highly popular forms are ghazal, qawwali, thumri, dhrupad, dadra, bhajan, kirtan, shabad, and gurbani.\nFilmi music is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of Ardeshir M. Irani's Alam Ara and its popular soundtrack. In the earliest years of the Indian cinema, filming was generally Indian (classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements. Over the years, the Western elements have increased, but without completely destroying the Indian flavour. Most of the Indian movies are musicals and feature elaborate song and dance numbers. There is constant work for pop music composers ‚Äî or music directors, to use the Indian term. Movie soundtracks are released as tapes and CDs, sometimes even before the movie is released.\n\n\n== Dance ==\n\nIndian classical dance is performed in different styles. Its theory can be traced back to the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni, a sage from Tamil Nadu (400 BC). The Natya Shastra is the most important ancient treatise on classical Indian dance. It is also called the fifth Veda in reference to the foundation of Hindu religion and philosophy, from which sprang the related South Indian musical tradition of Carnatic music. Its various current forms include Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Manipuri, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Mohiniaattam, Kathak and Sattriya.\nBharatanatyam is a classical dance form originating in Tamil Nadu. It is thought to have been created by Bharata Muni. In ancient times Bharatanatyam was performed by mandir (Hindu temple) Devadasis. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharatanatyam dance postures karanas.\nOdissi is one of the oldest surviving forms of dance, with depictions of Odissi dancing dating back as far as the 1st century BC. Like other forms of Indian classical dance, the Odissi style traces its origins back to antiquity. Dancers are found depicted in bas-relief in the hills of Udaygiri (near Bhubaneswar) dating back to the 1st century BC. The Natya Shastra speaks of the dance from this region and refers to it as Odra-Magadhi.\nKathakali (katha for story, kali for performance or play) is a form of dance-drama. It originated in the South Indian state of Kerala over 500 years ago. It is a spectacular combination of drama, dance, music and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes re-enact stories from the Hindu epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana.\nKuchipudi is a classical dance form from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, a state of South India. Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district that borders the Bay of Bengal and with resident Brahmins practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name.\nMohiniaattam is a traditional dance from the South Indian state of Kerala. Mohini is an Apsaras in the Hindu mythology and aattam in Malayalam means dance. So Mohiniaattam essentially means \"dance of the enchantress\". The theme of Mohiniaattam is love and devotion to god. The costume worn by the dancers are typically white coloured kasavu saree with golden borders.\nThe Kathak dance form arose from the Vaishnava devotees dancing to the episodes from Krishna's life. Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was transformed to a court dance in the Mughal era. The new Muslim influence brought with it certain changes to the dance form: what had been a largely devotional practice now became more a courtly entertainment.\nThe Sattriya dance is believed to be a creation of the great Vaishnavite (bhakti) guru Srimanta Sankardeva considered the lead architect of Assamese literature and culture. He created this magnificent Sattriya dance to accompany the Ankiya Naat (a form of Assamese one-act play, another creation of Sankardeva) which was usually performed in Satras (Assamese monasteries). Since the dance developed and grew within the Satras, it is named after these religious institutions.\nFolk dances are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels.\nBhangra is a form of music and dance that originated in the Punjab region of India. Bhangra dance began as a folk dance conducted by Punjabi farmers to celebrate the coming of Vaisakhi, a sikh festival. The specific moves reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The dance started from just one move and evolved later on. It has been popularized by Punjabi artists from the Sikh communities, with which it is now commonly associated.[1] Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe ‚Äì including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.\nThirayattam is a ritual performing dance of south malabar region (kozhikode and malappuram Dt:) in Kerala state. In Malayalam language, the word \"Thirayattam\" refers to a 'colourful dance'. This vibrant Ethnic art form blend of dance, instrumental music, drama, facial and body makeup, martial art and ritualistic Function. Thirayattam enacted in courtyards of sacred groves and village shrines, during Thirayattam festival.\n\n\n== Drama ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIndian drama and theatre has a long history alongside its music and dance. Kalidasa's plays like Shakuntala and Meghadoota are some of the older dramas, following those of Bhasa. Kutiyattam of Kerala, is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the Common Era, and is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It strictly follows the Natya Shastra. NƒÅtyƒÅchƒÅrya MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr is credited for reviving the age old drama tradition from extinction. He was known for mastery of Rasa Abhinaya. He started to perform the Kalidasa plays like Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntala, Vikramorva≈õƒ´ya and MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitra; Bhasa's SwapnavƒÅsavadatta and PancharƒÅtra; Harsha's Nagananda.\n\n\n== Shadow play ==\n\nShadow puppets are an ancient part of India's culture and art, particularly regionally as the keelu bomme and Tholu bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, the Togalu gombeyaata in Karnataka, the charma bahuli natya in Maharashtra, the Ravana chhaya in Odisha, the Tholpavakoothu in Kerala and the thol bommalatta in Tamil Nadu. Shadow puppet play is also found in pictorial traditions in India, such as temple mural painting, loose-leaf folio paintings, and the narrative paintings. Dance forms such as the Chhau of Odisha literally mean \"shadow\". The shadow theatre dance drama theatre are usually performed on platform stages attached to Hindu temples, and in some regions these are called Koothu Madams or Koothambalams. In many regions, the puppet drama play is performed by itinerant artist families on temporary stages during major temple festivals. Legends from the Hindu epics Ramayana and the Mahabharata dominate their repertoire. However, the details and the stories vary regionally.\nDuring the 19th century and early parts of the 20th century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts. In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra. The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue in many non-Marathi speaking states of India.\n\nAccording to Beth Osnes, the tholu bommalata shadow puppet theatre dates back to the 3rd century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since. The puppets used in a tholu bommalata performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are \"translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms\". The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the required art work, then celebrate the \"metaphorical birth of a puppet\" with flowers and incense.\nThe tholu pava koothu of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on a backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the Ramayana. A complete performance of the epic can take forty-one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days. One feature of the tholu pava koothu show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as the wayang of Indonesia are performed by a single puppeteer for the same Ramayana story. There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra. Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque puppets are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India.\n\n\n== Sculpture ==\n\nFirst sculptures in India date back to the Indus Valley Civilization, where stone and bronze carvings have been discovered. This is one of the earliest instances of sculpture in the world. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unrivalled temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at Ellora were not actually constructed using blocks, but instead carved out of solid rock, making them perhaps the largest and most intricate sculptures in the world.\nDuring the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.\nThe pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art that the world is now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.\nIndian Art was given a new lease of life by the British in early 19th century when the new government required painters to document Indian life and times. The English School paintings, as these new art were called had seen the emergence of India's greatest artists of all times Raja Ravi Verma. Other important artists of the Colonial period include Jamini Roy, Amrita Sher-Gil, Ramkinkar Baij and Rabindranath Tagore. After independence, Indian art became more diverse and artists like M. F. Husain, F. N. Souza, Subodh Gupta, Devajyoti Ray, Sudip Roy, Paresh Maity and Bose Krishnamachari earned international recognition.\n\nIndian art, ancient and medieval\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cinema ==\n\nIndia is a major regional center for cinema. The Indian film industry is the second largest in the world (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Odia. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in Mumbai, formerly Bombay, is called Bollywood (a melding of Hollywood and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry (Sandalwood) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry (Kollywood, from the Kodambakkam district of Chennai) and the Telugu film industry (Tollywood). Tollygunge is a metonym for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of Kolkata. The Bengali language industry is notable as including the director Satyajit Ray, an international filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the Bharat Ratna (India's highest civilian award), the L√©gion d'honneur (France), and the Lifetime achievement Academy Award. Odia film industry is known as Ollywood and it has a history of film making since 1936. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India.\n\n\n== Radio ==\n\nRadio broadcasting was, until recently a government monopoly under the Directorate General of All India Radio‚Äîestablished in 1936 and since 1957 also known as Akashvani‚Äîa government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations at the time of independence, All India Radio's network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the External Service. There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India's populace.\nThe government-owned network provides both national and local programs in Hindi, English, and sixteen regional languages. Commercial services, which were inaugurated in 1957, are provided by Vividh Bharati Service, headquartered in Mumbai. Vividh Bharati, which accepts advertisements, broadcasts from thirty-one AM and FM stations in the mid-1990s.\nIndia has an extensive network of medium wave and shortwave stations. In 1994 there were eighty-five FM stations and seventy-three shortwave stations that covered the entire country. The broadcasting equipment is mostly Indian made and reaches special audiences, such as farmers needing agroclimatic, plant protection, and other agriculture-related information. The number of radio receivers increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1994, from around 14 million to nearly 65 million. Most radios are also produced within India.\nThe foreign broadcast service is a function of the External Services Division of All India Radio. In 1994 seventy hours of news, features, and entertainment programs were broadcast daily in twenty-five languages using thirty-two shortwave transmitters. The principal target audiences are listeners in neighbouring countries and the large overseas Indian community.\nSatellite Radio was introduced to the Indian market in 2000 by WorldSpace, a Washington DC‚Äìbased company. Currently WorldSpace beams 30 channels comprising music, news, and regional channels, a subscriber in India pays ‚Çπ1,200 per annum. In addition, some premium channels are available at an extra cost. This service requires special receivers which are often subsidized by world space.\nRecently The Department of Space (DoS) indicated it is exploring the possibility of setting up a multi-media satellite platform that would include satellite radio, video and data channels.\n\n\n== Television ==\n\nTelevision service is available throughout the country. Doordarshan is a government-owned broadcaster established in 1959 and a part of All India Radio until 1976. It operates of one national network and seven regional networks. In 1992 there were sixty-three high-power television transmitters, 369 medium-power transmitters, seventy-six low-power transmitters, and twenty-three transposers. Regular satellite transmissions began in 1982 (the same year colour transmission began).\nBy 1994 some six million people were receiving television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly throughout the rest of the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, Zee TV‚Äîan independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992‚Äîuses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, Zee TV and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are Cable News Network (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong‚Äìbased Star TV (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the Hindustan Times in New Delhi (1994); and Sun TV, a Tamil language service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service. The number of television sets increased from around 500,000 in 1976 to 9 million in early 1987 and to around 47 million in 1994; increases are expected to continue at around six million sets per year. More than 75 percent of television sets were black and white models in 1992, but the proportion of colour sets is increasing annually. Most television sets are produced in India.\n\n\n=== Major events ===\n\n\n=== Professional events ===\nLakme Fashion Week\nPonds Femina Miss India\nGlobal Festival of Films on Peace and Spirituality\n\n\n=== Amateur events ===\nCulfests in India\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.

      "summary": "Arts and architecture in India have been shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia, since ancient times. Arts refer to paintings, architecture, literature, music, dance, languages and cinema. In early India, most of the arts were derived Vedic influences. After the birth of contemporary Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of Islam spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.\n\n",

      "title": "Atithi Devo Bhava",
      "content": "Atithidevo Bhava (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§§‡§ø‡§•‡§ø‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ), translated as A guest is akin to God, embodies the traditional Indian Hindu-Buddhist philosophy of treating guests with the reverence accorded to deities. This principle extends beyond the customary greeting of Namaste (I bow to the divinity in you) used universally in these cultures.\n\n\n== Etymology and Common Misspelling ==\nThe phrase Atithidevo Bhava is derived from the Sanskrit words:\nAtithi (‡§Ö‡§§‡§ø‡§•‡§ø) ‚Äì meaning guest\nDeva (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ) ‚Äì meaning god\nBhava (‡§≠‡§µ) ‚Äì meaning to become or to consider as\nA common misspelling of this phrase is Atithi Devo Bhava, which incorrectly inserts a space between Atithi and Devo, altering the intended grammatical structure in Sanskrit. However, this incorrect spelling has gained popularity, particularly due to its usage in tourism campaigns and media.\n\n\n== Origin in Upanishads ==\nThe mantra originates from the Taittiriya Upanishad, Shikshavalli I.11.2, which states:\n\n‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•É‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ, ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ, ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡•É‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ, ‡§™‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ, ‡§Ü‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ, ‡§Ö‡§§‡§ø‡§•‡§ø‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ\nThis translates to:\n\nBe one for whom the Mother is God, be one for whom the Friend is God, be one for whom the Father is God, be one for whom the Child is God, be one for whom the Teacher is God, and be one for whom the Guest is God.\nEach of these phrases (MƒÅt·πõdevo bhava, Mitradevo bhava, Pit·πõdevo bhava, Putradevo bhava, ƒÄcƒÅryadevo bhava, and Atithidevo bhava) is a single word formed as a Bahuvrihi samƒÅsa (compound word).\n\n\n== Ritual or Puja ==\nIn Sanatana Dharma, a personal deity is worshipped through a five-step ritual called Panchopachara Puja. A more elaborate version, Shodashopachara Puja, consists of 16 steps. The five steps of worship translate into essential formalities when receiving guests:\nFragrance (Dhupa) ‚Äì Ensuring the room has a pleasant aroma creates a welcoming environment.\nLamp (Dipa) ‚Äì Traditionally, a lamp was placed between the host and guest to illuminate expressions and body language.\nEatables (Naivedya) ‚Äì Offering guests fruits, sweets, or milk-based dishes.\nRice (Akshata) ‚Äì Applying a Tilaka, often made of vermilion, on the guest‚Äôs forehead with rice grains symbolizes unity.\nFlower offering (Pushpa) ‚Äì Presenting a flower as a token of goodwill, symbolizing sweet memories of the visit.\n\n\n== Government of India Campaign ==\nIndia attracts millions of tourists annually. To enhance the experience of foreign visitors, the Indian Ministry of Tourism launched the Atithi Devo Bhava campaign under the broader theme of Incredible India.\nThe campaign focuses on promoting hospitality values among tourism industry stakeholders such as taxi drivers, tour guides, immigration officers, and police personnel. It aims to ensure that tourists feel safe, welcomed, and respected throughout their stay in India.\n\n\n== See Also ==\nCulture of India\nHospitality\nIncredible India\nPuja (Hinduism)\nStranded in India\n\n\n== References ==",

      "content": "The Chahi Taret Khuntakpa (Meitei: ÍØÜÍØçÍØ§ ÍØáÍØîÍØ¶ÍØ† ÍØàÍØ®ÍØüÍØáÍØ•ÍØõÍØÑ), also known as the Seven Years Devastation, was a period in the history of Manipur when the Manipur Kingdom was occupied by the Burmese from 1819 to 1826 CE (3212‚Äì3218 MF in the Meitei calendar).\nThe Chahi Taret Khuntakpa caused destruction, war, and the near collapse of the Meitei population. Many Meitei people were killed, and others fled to Assam, Tripura, Sylhet, and even Myanmar.\nThe Burmese invasion began during the rule of King Marjit Singh and was led by Burmese general Mingimala Bandula. Marjit, along with his brothers Chourjit Singh and Gambhir Singh, fled to Cachar.\nIn 1824, the First Anglo-Burmese War began. Gambhir Singh formed a group called the Manipur Levy with 500‚Äì2,000 men, trained and supported by the British under Captain Grant. This force successfully fought the Burmese and pushed them out of Manipur.\nIn February 1826, the Treaty of Yandabo was signed. It ended the war and officially restored Gambhir Singh as the King of Manipur.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Burmese aggression in Manipur was a prolonged period of military invasions and political upheaval, spanning from the 15th to the 18th century. The decline of Manipur‚Äôs political stability began after the death of Meitei King Garibnawaz (Pamheiba), leading to a weakened state and internal conflicts. The political history of Manipur during this era is characterized by frequent Burmese invasions, internal disputes, and succession conflicts, marked by instances of treason, intrigue, and rebellion.\nBetween 1758 and 1824, the Burmese army conducted multiple invasions of Manipur, resulting in widespread devastation over a period of 66 years. These invasions forced the Meitei population to flee due to political persecution, with many seeking refuge in neighboring regions such as Cachar, Tripura, East Bengal, and Assam.\nThe first significant Burmese invasion occurred in 1755 under the leadership of Alaungpaya (also known as Alempara), the founder of the Burmese dynasty. Alaungpaya, a prominent military leader, launched an expedition to Manipur during the reign of Meitei King Moramba Gourashyam (1753‚Äì1759) to subdue the Meiteis. The Burmese forces employed firearms, which were unfamiliar to the Meitei troops and created widespread fear. The resulting panic led to the mass exodus of the Meitei population, leaving the Manipur plains largely deserted. This event is historically referred to as \"Khuntak Ahaanba\" or \"the first great devastation.\"\n\nFollowing this, Meitei King Gourashyam entered into a treaty with the Burmese, agreeing to send a young man and a woman from his family as hostages.\nHowever, two years after the treaty, Alaungpaya‚Äôs dissatisfaction with the Meiteis led to another invasion in 1758. He personally led his forces up to the Ningthee River, defeated the Meitei army at Pallel, and advanced into Imphal. The Burmese occupied Imphal for two weeks, during which they looted the kingdom and massacred thousands of Meitei captives. Upon their return, they took thousands of Meitei men and women, including skilled artisans such as silk workers and silversmiths.\nIn 1762, Meitei King Bheigyachandra ascended the throne. During his reign, the Burmese king Hsibyushin (1763‚Äì1776) defeated the Meiteis again at Kakching in 1764. From 1764 to 1793, Meitei King Bheigyachandra experienced multiple changes in power, losing and regaining his throne at least three times. In 1782, he was overthrown and, along with his family and followers, sought political asylum in neighboring principalities.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nThe roots of this devastation lay in the intense power struggles among the surviving sons of King Bheigyachandra, who vied for control over the throne. This succession dispute fragmented the kingdom into hostile factions, each led by different royal family members. The prominent figures in this conflict were Sanahal, Labanya (also known as Robindrachandra), Modhuchandra, Tulsijit, Chourajit, Marjit, Daoji (Khongjai Ngamba), and Gambhir Singh‚Äîthe eight sons of Bheigyachandra.\nSanahal, the eldest son, predeceased his father, which further complicated the succession. In 1798, Bheigyachandra appointed Labanya as king before leaving for Nabadwip. However, in 1801, Daoji and Gambhir Singh conspired to have Labanya assassinated, leading to further instability. Following this, Modhuchandra seized power briefly but struggled to maintain control and eventually left for Nabadwip in 1803. After his defeat at the battle of Sangaithen, he fled to Cachar, where he formed an alliance with the local ruler, Krishna Chandra, through marriage. Ultimately, Modhuchandra was defeated and killed by his brother, Chourajit, at Bishnupur.\n\n\n== Burmese Intervention and the Fall of Manipur ==\nChourajit, who ruled from 1803 to 1812, faced continuous challenges in maintaining political stability, particularly in his strained relationship with his brother Marjit Singh. This rivalry eventually forced Chourajit to flee to Tumu, Burma, where he sought support from the Burmese king Bodawpaya. In 1817, Bodawpaya facilitated a reconciliation between Chourajit and Marjit Singh, but this arrangement was short-lived.\nDuring the winter of 1817, Bodawpaya sent a military force led by Marjit Singh, which defeated Chourajit‚Äôs forces at Kakching Khulen. Marjit Singh then ascended to the throne of Manipur as a vassal of Burma. However, his reign was marked by attempts to assert autonomy, particularly when he allowed his subjects to collect timber in the Kabo Valley without seeking permission from the Burmese authorities. This act of defiance angered the Burmese court, which led to renewed conflict.\n\n\n== Final Phase of Devastation ==\nAfter Bodawpaya‚Äôs death in 1819, Bagyidaw became the new Burmese ruler. Shortly after his coronation, Bagyidaw ordered Marjit Singh to present himself at the Burmese court to pay homage. Marjit Singh‚Äôs refusal to comply with this demand prompted the Burmese to dispatch an army under the command of Mingimuha to capture him. After an unsuccessful confrontation, Marjit Singh fled to Cachar along with his royal attendants.\nWith Marjit Singh‚Äôs departure, the Burmese forces completely overran Manipur. The subsequent occupation was marked by widespread violence, mass killings, forced displacements, and the systematic extermination of the Meitei population. The Burmese conducted ruthless military campaigns, destroying villages, looting resources, and causing immense suffering among the local population.\n\n\n== Herachandra's contributions to freedom struggle ==\n\nAfter the overthrow of Marjit Singh by the Burmese, Herachandra, the son of Labanyachandra, initiated a guerrilla campaign against the Burmese forces with the support of a small group of followers. Herachandra‚Äôs resistance is remembered for its patriotism and bravery. The movement gained momentum as more Meiteis joined in opposition to the Burmese occupation and its associated abuses. According to the Royal Chronicle, the first significant engagement led by Herachandra resulted in a considerable victory for the Meiteis, who killed approximately 200 of the 500 Burmese troops on their way to Moirang to gather food in early 1820. Subsequent encounters between the two forces resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. In response to the growing resistance, the Burmese sent additional reinforcements to Manipur in November 1820 to strengthen their control.\n\n\n== Manipur Levy's contributions to freedom struggle ==\n\nDuring a period of widespread unrest and destruction caused by the Burmese occupation, the then Meitei prince Gambhir Singh, who had established an agreement with the British government, mobilized a force of 500 men with the support of his followers. This force contributed to the British efforts in driving the Burmese out of Cachar. By 1825, the force had expanded to 2,000 members and was formally known as the Manipur Levy. It was placed under the command of Captain Grant, a British officer, and was provided with payment, accounting, and ammunition by the British government.\n\n\n== British assistance ==\nDuring the Burmese occupation, General Bandula of the Burmese army overestimated the strength and capabilities of his forces. He assured the Burmese king that his army could easily conquer Bengal, convincing the king and his nobles of Burmese superiority over the British. This proved to be a significant miscalculation. The British had previously maintained a policy of non-interference on the eastern frontier, which allowed the Burmese to occupy Assam. Additionally, Governor Govindchandra‚Äôs request for British assistance in Cachar against the Meitei princes was not addressed. As a result, Govindchandra sought support from the Burmese, which was granted. In 1824, three Burmese army divisions from Jaintia, Assam, and Manipur converged on Cachar, with plans to invade the British district of Sylhet, causing alarm among British authorities.\nIn response, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of India, declared war on Burma on 5 March 1824. Prior to the battle of Jatrapur, the Burmese commander stated that their objective was to capture the three Manipuri princes‚ÄîChaurajit Singh, Marjit Singh, and Gambhir Singh. After the declaration of war, British forces inflicted heavy losses on the Burmese, with over 3,000 casualties in Cachar alone. The British launched simultaneous military operations against Burma, attacking by land in Assam and Arakan and by sea at Yangon. While British forces managed to maintain their positions in Assam and Arakan, they faced logistical challenges and geographical obstacles that limited their progress. Despite these difficulties, Burma was weakened by attacks on multiple fronts.\nAs supplies became scarce, General Bandula returned to Burma from the Assam front, facing a critical situation. At this time, Gambhir Singh, accompanied by British officer Lieutenant R.B. Pemberton, advanced into Manipur. After overcoming numerous obstacles, they reached the Manipur valley on 10 June 1825. Gambhir Singh‚Äôs leadership was demonstrated in the battle of Tilain, supported by British forces. Determined to liberate Manipur, Gambhir Singh, with his Manipur Levy armed by the British, arrived from Sylhet on 17 May 1825, leading to a confrontation with the Burmese forces.\nFollowing their first encounter, the Burmese forces retreated to Andro, about 20 km east of Imphal. Gambhir Singh pursued them, but the Burmese withdrew again. After his campaign, Gambhir Singh returned to Sylhet, leaving 300 soldiers to defend Manipur. During his absence, Nara Singh served as the commander-in-chief. In Sylhet, Gambhir Singh received an additional 1,500 muskets from the British. After raising more troops, he returned to Manipur with Captain Grant and reinforcements.\nUpon his return, the Meitei forces, now well-armed and organized, forced around 400 Burmese soldiers in the Kabaw Valley to retreat. Key Burmese officials, including the chief of Samjok, a Burmese general, and 22 soldiers, were captured. The local Manipuri forces, though initially untrained in advanced weaponry, played a significant role in supporting the trained external forces in expelling the invaders. The Manipuri army defeated the Burmese at Tamu, captured the Samjok prince and others, and subsequently devastated the capital of Samjok. They planted their standard on the Chindwin River, marking the completion of the Kabaw Valley‚Äôs liberation.\nGambhir Singh‚Äôs leadership established him as a significant figure in Manipur. On 1 February 1826, he arrived on the western bank of the Chindwin River to find the area deserted, as the inhabitants had fled, leaving behind cattle and allowing Meitei prisoners to escape. The death of General Bandula in April 1825 during the battle at Donabew, alongside British officer Archibald Campbell, deeply affected the Burmese emperor Bagyidaw. Recognizing the extent of Burmese defeats, Bagyidaw sought peace, although he initially rejected British terms.\nDespite some Burmese forces continuing to operate in Assam, Manipur, and northern Burma, the British and Meitei forces continued to advance. British forces, under Campbell, captured Yandaboo, just 45 miles from Ava, the Burmese capital. With defensive options diminishing, the war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Yandaboo on 24 February 1826. The treaty established \"perpetual peace and friendship\" between the British and Burmese, with the king of Ava renouncing all claims to Assam, Cachar, Jaintia, and other small princely states.\n\n\n== Aftermath and Legacy ==\nThe impact of the Chahi Taret Khuntakpa was devastating. The population of Manipur was drastically reduced, with estimates suggesting that the adult male population fell to fewer than 3,000 individuals. The survivors, many of whom had fled to the hills or neighboring regions, continued to preserve the composite Manipuri identity, which includes both the Meitei of the plains and the various tribal communities of the hills.\nThis period of devastation reshaped the demographic and political landscape of Manipur. The survivors, despite enduring immense trauma, contributed to the resilience and revival of Manipuri society in the subsequent years. The Chahi Taret Khuntakpa remains a defining event in the historical consciousness of the Manipuri people, symbolizing both the fragility and the endurance of their cultural identity.\n\n\n== Historical Perspective ==\nHistorian Pemberton remarked on the severity of the Burmese campaigns, stating that the devastating operations ‚Äúswept away the country from one extremity to another with the apparent determination of extirpating a race when they found it impossible permanently to subdue.‚Äù The Chahi Taret Khuntakpa not only reshaped the demographic and political landscape of Manipur but also left an indelible mark on the historical consciousness of its people.\nThe events of this period continue to be remembered as a somber chapter in Manipur‚Äôs history, reflecting the enduring impact of external aggression, internal conflicts, and the resilience of a people who, despite facing near-extinction, managed to preserve their cultural heritage and identity.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMeitei people in Myanmar\nMeitei clothing in Myanmar\nMeitei people in Bangladesh\nMeitei clothing in Bangladesh\nMeitei monuments in Bangladesh\nMeitei people in Assam\nMeitei people in Tripura\nMeitei people in Nagaland\nMeitei people in Meghalaya\nBurmese‚ÄìMeitei relations\nMeitei‚ÄìShan relations\nMeitei martial arts\nMeitei traditional weapons\nMeitei traditional toys\nMeitei traditional games\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nhttp://anoubameerol.com/review-of-n-birachandras-seven-years-devastation/ Archived 2021-02-13 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Districts of British India",
      "content": "The districts of British India were key administrative units of the British Raj, or Indian Empire, serving as subdivisions of the provinces and divisions of British India. These districts, often referred to as zillas in vernacular languages, played a crucial role in the governance and administration of British India, managing local affairs such as revenue collection, law enforcement, and public works. Most districts established during the British period became the foundation for modern districts of India and districts of Pakistan after the partition of India in 1947.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe district system in British India evolved from earlier administrative structures under the Mughal Empire, where regions were divided into sarkars and parganas. The British East India Company, after gaining control over Bengal in the mid-18th century, began formalizing districts as administrative units to streamline governance and revenue collection. By the early 19th century, districts were firmly established across British India, each headed by a district collector or magistrate responsible for local administration.\nDistricts were further grouped into divisions, which were overseen by commissioners, and these divisions were part of larger provinces. This hierarchical structure allowed the British to maintain control over vast territories with diverse populations. The districts' boundaries and administrative functions evolved over time, reflecting changes in British policies and local needs.\nFollowing the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Crown assumed direct control over India, and the district system was further standardized. By the early 20th century, districts were the primary units for local governance, with responsibilities including judicial administration, public health, education, and infrastructure development.\nAt the time of the partition of India in 1947, most districts were reorganized into the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan, with some districts split along religious lines. Today, the legacy of these districts continues in the administrative frameworks of both countries.\n\n\n== List of districts ==\nBelow is a list of districts in British India as of 1947, organized by province and division.

      "title": "Satavahana dynasty",
      "content": "The Satavahanas (; SƒÅdavƒÅhana or SƒÅtavƒÅhana, IAST: SƒÅtavƒÅhana), also referred to as the Andhras (also Andhra-bh·πõtyas or Andhra-jatiyas) in the Puranas, were an ancient Indian dynasty. Most modern scholars believe that the Satavahana rule began in the late 2nd century BCE and lasted until the early 3rd century CE, although some assign the beginning of their rule to as early as the 3rd century BCE based on the Puranas, but uncorroborated by archaeological evidence. The Satavahana kingdom mainly comprised the present-day Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. At different times, their rule extended to parts of modern Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka. The dynasty had different capital cities at different times, including Pratishthana (Paithan) and Amaravati (Dharanikota).\nThe origin of the dynasty is uncertain, but according to the Puranas, their first king overthrew the Kanva dynasty. In the post-Maurya era, the Satavahanas established peace in the Deccan region and resisted the onslaught of foreign invaders. In particular their struggles with the Saka (Western Satraps) went on for a long time. The dynasty reached its zenith under the rule of Gautamiputra Satakarni and his successor Vasisthiputra Pulamavi. The kingdom had fragmented into smaller states by the early 3rd century CE.\nThe Satavahanas were early issuers of Indian state coinage struck with images of their rulers. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade and the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe date and place of origin of the Satavahanas, as well as the meaning of the dynasty's name, are a matter of debate among historians. Some of these debates have happened in the context of regionalism, with the present-day Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana being variously claimed as the original homeland of the Satavahanas.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana, ≈öƒÅlivƒÅhana, ≈öƒÅtakar·πái seem to be Sanskritised versions of the indigenous name SƒÅtaka·πái, which appear as SƒÅlavƒÅha·πáa in Prakrit vernacular.\nAccording to one theory, the word \"Satavahana\" (Brahmi script: ëÄ≤ëÄ∏ëÄ§ëÄØëÄ∏ëÄ≥ëÄ¶ SƒÅdavƒÅhana or ëÄ≤ëÄ∏ëÄ¢ëÄØëÄ∏ëÄ≥ëÄ¶ SƒÅtavƒÅhana, IAST: SƒÅtavƒÅhana) is a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit Sapta-Vahana (\"driven by seven\"; in Hindu mythology, the chariot of the sun god is drawn by seven horses). This would indicate that the Satavahanas originally claimed association with the legendary solar dynasty, as was common in ancient India. According to Inguva Kartikeya Sarma, the dynasty's name is derived from the words sata (\"sharpened\", \"nimble\" or \"swift\") and vahana (\"vehicle\"); the expression thus means \"one who rides a nimble horse\".\nAnother theory connects their name to the earlier Satiyaputa dynasty. Yet another theory derives their name from the Munda words Sadam (\"horse\") and Harpan (\"son\"), implying \"son of the performer of a horse sacrifice\". Several rulers of the dynasty bear the name or title \"Satakarni\". Satavahana, Satakarni, Satakani and Shalivahana appear to be variations of the same word. Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi theorised that the word \"Satakarni\" is derived from the Munda words sada (\"horse\") and kon (\"son\").\nThe Puranas use the name \"Andhra\" for the Satavahanas. The term \"Andhra\" may refer to the ethnicity or territory of the dynasty (see Original homeland below). It does not appear in the dynasty's own records.\nThe Tamil epic Cilappatikaram mentions a \"Nurruvar Kannar\", who helped Chera king Senguttuvan during his Himalayan campaign. The direct translation of the term Nurruvar Kannar is \"the hundred Karnas\" or \"Satakarni\"; Nurruvar Kannar has therefore been identified with the Satavahana dynasty.\nThe Kathasaritsagara ascribes a mythical etymology in which a widowed, childless king named Deepakarni was prophesied to find a lion-riding child as his heir. During a jungle hunt, he found such a child riding a yaksha-turned-lion named SƒÅta. After adoption, the child became the king eventually and came to be known as SƒÅtavƒÅhana or SƒÅta-supported.\n\n\n=== Original homeland ===\n\nThe use of the names \"Andhra\" and \"Andhra-Jatiya\" in the Puranas has led some scholars, such as E. J. Rapson and R.G Bhandarkar, to believe that the dynasty originated in the eastern Deccan region (the historic Andhra region, present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). At Kotilingala in Telangana, coins bearing the legend \"Rano Siri Chimuka Satavahanasa\" were found. Epigraphist and numismatist P. V. P. Sastry initially identified Chimuka with the dynasty's founder Simuka, Coins attributed to Simuka's successors Kanha and Satakarni I were also discovered at Kotilingala. Based on these discoveries, historians such as Ajay Mitra Shastri, D. R. Reddy, S. Reddy, and Shankar R. Goyal theorised that Kotlingala was the original home of the Satavahanas. Ajay Mitra Shastri stated that the finding of the coins at Kotilingala give \"a clear pointer to the region where we have to locate the original center of the Satavahana political authority.\" However, the coin samples from Kotlingala are small, and it is not certain if these coins were minted there or reached there from somewhere else. Moreover, the identification of Chimuka of Kotilingala with the dynasty's founder Simuka has been contested by several scholars including P. L. Gupta and I. K. Sarma, who identified Chimuka as a later ruler. P. V. P. Sastry also later changed his view and stated that the two kings were different. In addition to the Kotilinga find, a coin of the Satavahana prince Saktikumara, who was in the fourth generation of the founder, has been reported as a stratified find from the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. As for the Puranas, these texts could have been compiled at a later date and it is not certain if the Satavahanas were referred to as Andhras during their time.\nAnother section of scholars believe that the Satavahanas originated in western Deccan (present-day Maharashtra). All four extant inscriptions from the early Satavahana period (c. 1st century BCE) have been found in and around this region. One of the earliest known Satavahana inscriptions was that found at Cave No.19 of the Pandavleni Caves in Nashik district, which was issued during the reign of Kanha (100‚Äì70 BCE). An inscription found at Naneghat was issued by Nayanika (or Naganika), the widow of Satakarni I; another inscription found at Naneghat has been dated to the same period on a paleographic basis. A slightly later inscription dated to the reign of Satakarni II has been found at Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh, located to the north of Maharashtra. The majority of the other Satavahana inscriptions have also been found in western Deccan. On the other hand, the epigraphic evidence from eastern Deccan does not mention the Satavahanas before the 4th century CE. At Nevasa, a seal and coins attributed to Kanha have been discovered. Coins attributed to Satakarni I have also been discovered at Nashik, Nevasa, and Pauni in Maharashtra (besides places in eastern Deccan and present-day Madhya Pradesh). Based on this evidence, some historians argue that the Satavahanas initially came to power in the area around their capital Pratishthana (modern Paithan, Maharashtra) and then expanded their territory to eastern Deccan. Carla Sinopoli cautions that the inference about the western Deccan origin of the Satavahanas is \"tentative at best\" given the small sample of early inscriptions.\n\nKanha's Pandavleni mentions the term maha-matra (officer-in-charge), which indicates that the early Satavahanas followed the Mauryan administrative model. C. Margabandhu theorised that the Satavahanas were called Andhras because they were natives of eastern Deccan (the Andhra region), although they first established their empire in western Deccan after having served as Mauryan subordinates. Himanshu Prabha Ray (1986) opposes this theory, stating that the Andhra was originally an ethnic term, and did not come to denote the geographical region of eastern Deccan until well after the Satavahana period. According to Vidya Dehejia, the writers of the Puranas (which could have been written after the Satavahana period) mistook the Satavahana presence in eastern Deccan as evidence for their origin in that region, and wrongly labelled them as \"Andhra\".\nPuranas called the Satavahana kings as Andhras, Andhra-bh·πõtya, or Andhra-jatiya. Andhras is both a tribal and a territorial name. The term Andhrabhrityas (Andhra servants) may imply two things, one being that the Andhras were originally servants of the Mauryas or the Sungas. The other one, as per some scholars is that the expression is taken to indicate the servants of some other Andhra rulers. These scholars also suggest Kannada origin for the Satavahanas meaning that the dynasty originated in present-day Karnataka, and initially owed allegiance to some Andhra rulers. A Satavahana inscription found on a slab of the upper drum (medhi) of the Kanaganahalli mahastupa mentions year 16 of Vasisthiputra Sri Chimuka Satavahana's reign, which can be dated from ca. 110 BCE. V. S. Sukthankar theorised that the territorial division Satavahani-Satahani (Satavahanihara or Satahani-rattha), in present-day Bellary district, was the homeland of the Satavahana family. However, Dr. Gopalchari challenged Sukthankar's theory by pointing out that not a single inscription of the early Satavahanas is found in Bellary District and that the only Satavahana inscription in Bellary District was that of Pulumavi, who belongs to the later-phase of Satavahana history. A stupa in Kanaganahalli village of Karnataka, dated between the first century BCE and first century CE, features limestone panels depicting portraits of Chimuka (Simuka), Satakani (Satakarni) and other Satavahana rulers. As per historian Parmanand Gupta, in the medieval times, Srisailam region or the Sriparvata area was known as Kannadu and Kannavisaya which is the contracted form of Satakarninadu and Satakarnivisaya, which seem to be identical with the territorial indicator Satavahanihara of the Myakadoni inscription of Pulumayi or the Satavahaniratta of the Hirahadagalli grant consisting of the Ballari region indicated to be the original homeland of the Satavahanas as per another historian V. S. Sukthankar. \nAccording to Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi, the Satavahanas, likely originated in Western Maharashtra. Jain literature traces the PratishthƒÅna (present-day Paithan in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra) as the early Satvahana ruler's capital, Saktikumara. Similarly, the ancient geographer Ptolemy mentioned a king called PuƒºumƒÅvi ruled from the same city sometime in around 140 CE. Now, the question is, why are these rulers referred to as \"Andhra\"? This can be explained through the dynastic lists recorded in the Puranas, which were likely compiled around 320 CE. He infers that these lists do not reference dynasties or rulers after this period, and the Satavahanas had already declined by circa 230 CE. By the time of their decline, the center of Satvahana power had shifted to the Andhra region. An inscription of the later king Gautamiputra Vijaya Satakarni was found at Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh, where he is said to have made Vijayapuri, the city mentioned as Nagarjunakonda, his capital. His coins also do not exist in Western Maharashtra, which was then the dominion of another king known as Chutukula Satakarni.\n\n\n=== Varna ===\nThe varna of the dynasty is debated by modern scholars, who have variously argued for Shudra, Kshatriya, and Brahmana origins of the dynasty.\nThe Puranas call the founder of the Satavahana family a v·πõ·π£ala (Shudra or low-born).\nThe Nashik inscription of Gautami Balashri describes her son Gautamiputra Satakarni as eka-bamhana (Sanskrit: eka-brahmana). Some scholars, such as V.V. Mirashi, have interpreted the term as \"sole Brahmana\", and argued that Satavahanas were Brahmanas. Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri interprets the term as \"unique Brahmana\", and notes that the inscription also describes Gautamiputra as \"the destroyer of the pride and conceit of Kshatriyas\", which according to him strongly suggests that Gautamiputra claimed to be a Brahmana.\nThe critics of this theory point out that Gautamiputra's family had matrimonial relations with the non-Brahmana Shakas, and the Satavahanas could not have been Brahmanas because the same inscription also describes Gautamiputra as the one who stopped admixture of varnas (vinivatita chatu vana sankara). Historian V. Sundara Rama Sastry argues that the interpretation of the term \"eka-bamhana\" as \"the only Brahmana\" does not make sense as the king was obviously not the only member of his varna: instead, he interprets the term as an epithet indicating that the king \"excelled even the Brahmans\". Historian R. G. Bhandarkar interprets the term \"the only protector\" of the Brahmanas.\nSome Jain works and the DvƒÅtri·πÉ≈õat-PuttalikƒÅ represent Shalivahana (whom some modern scholars identify as a Satavahana king) as of mixed Brahmana and Naga origin. Based on this, some scholars, such as D.C. Sircar, theorize that the Satavahanas were originally non-Brahmanas who started claiming Brahmana status after establishing matrimonial relations with some Brahmana families.\n\n\n== History ==\nInformation about the Satavahanas comes from the Puranas, some Buddhist and Jain texts, the dynasty's inscriptions and coins, and foreign (Greek and Roman) accounts that focus on trade. The information provided by these sources is not sufficient to reconstruct the dynasty's history with absolute certainty. As a result, there are multiple theories about the Satavahana chronology.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nSimuka is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Naneghat. The various Puranas state that the first king of the dynasty ruled for 23 years, and mention his name variously as Sishuka, Sindhuka, Chhismaka, Shipraka, etc. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of Simuka, resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts. Simuka cannot be dated with certainty based on available evidence. Based on the following theories, the beginning of the Satavahana rule is dated variously from 271 BCE to 30 BCE. According to the Puranas, the first Andhra king overthrew the Kanva rule. He is named as Balipuccha in some texts. D. C. Sircar dated this event to c. 30 BCE, a theory supported by many other scholars.\nThe Matsya Purana mentions that the Andhra dynasty ruled for around 450 years. As the Satavahana rule ended in the early 3rd century, the beginning of their rule can be dated to the 3rd century BCE. The Indica of Megasthenes (350 ‚Äì 290 BCE) mentions a powerful tribe named \"Andarae\", whose king maintained an army of 100,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. If Andarae is identified with the Andhras, this can be considered additional evidence of Satavahana rule starting in the 3rd century BCE. The Brahmanda Purana states that \"the four Kanvas will rule the earth for 45 years; then (it) will again go to the Andhras\". Based on this statement, the proponents of this theory argue that the Satavahana rule began immediately after the Maurya rule, followed by a Kanva interregnum, and then, a revival of the Satavahana rule. According to one version of the theory Simuka succeeded the Mauryans. A variation of the theory is that Simuka was the person who restored the Satavahana rule by overthrowing the Kanvas; the compiler of the Puranas confused him with the founder of the dynasty.\nMost modern scholars believe that the Satavahana ruler began in the 1st century BCE and lasted until the 2nd century CE. This theory is based on Puranic records as well as archaeological and numismatic evidence. The theory that dates their rule to an earlier period is now largely discredited because the various Puranas contradict each other, and are not fully supported by epigraphic or numismatic evidence.\nThe oldest Satavahana inscription is the one found on a slab of the upper drum (medhi) of the Kanaganahalli Great Stupa mentioning year 16 of Vasisthiputra Sri Chimuka Satavahana's reign, which can be dated from ca. 110 BCE.\n\nëÄ≠ëÄ∏ëÄúëÅÑ ëÄ≤ëÄ∫ëÄ≠ëÄ∫ ëÄôëÄ∫ëÄ´ëÄºëÄì ëÄ≤ëÄ∏ëÄ¢ëÄØëÄ∏ëÄ≥ëÄ¶ëÄ≤ ëÄ≤ëÅÑëÄüëÅÇ  ëÄØëÄôëÄ≠ëÅÇ ëÅõëÅó ëÄ´ëÄ∏ëÄ¢ëÄ∫ëÄ≤ëÅÇëÄì\nRano siri chimu(ka) sƒÅtavƒÅhanasa so·∏çe vachare 10 6  mƒÅtiseka\n\n\"In the year sixteen 16 of King Siri Chimuka SƒÅtavƒÅhana\"\nOn another stone slab at Kanaganahalli, the king is possibly shown together with a Nagaraja, and the inscription reads:\n\nëÄ≠ëÄ∏ëÄöëÄ∏ ëÄ≤ëÄ∫ëÄ≠ëÄ∫ ëÄôëÄ∫ëÄ´ëÄºëÄìëÅÑ ëÄ≤ëÄ∏ëÄ§ëÄØëÄ∏ëÄ≥ëÄ¶ëÅÑ ëÄ¶ëÄ∏ëÄïëÄ≠ëÄ∏ëÄ¨ ëÄ≤ëÄîëÄ•ëÄ∏ëÄ™ëÅÑRƒÅjƒÅ Siri Chimuko SƒÅdavƒÅhano nƒÅgarƒÅya SakhadhƒÅbho\"Lord King Simuka the Satavahana, Nagaraja SakhadhƒÅbho\"\n\n\n=== Early expansion ===\n\nSimuka was succeeded by his brother Kanha (also known as Krishna), who extended the kingdom up to Nashik in the west. His successor Satakarni I conquered western Malwa, Anupa (Narmada valley) and Vidarbha, taking advantage of the turmoil caused by Greek invasions of northern India. He performed Vedic sacrifices including Ashvamedha and Rajasuya. Instead of the Buddhists, he patronised Brahmins and donated a substantial amount of wealth to them. The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga king Kharavela mentions a king named \"Satakani\" or \"Satakamini\", who some identify with Satakarni I. The inscription describes dispatching of an army and Kharavela's threat to a city. Since the inscription is only partially legible, different scholars interpret the events described in the inscription differently. According to R. D. Banerji and Sailendra Nath Sen, Kharavela sent out an army against Satakarni. According to Bhagwal Lal, Satakarni wanted to avoid an invasion of his kingdom by Kharavela. So, he sent horses, elephants, chariots and men to Kharavela as a tribute. According to Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya, Kharavela's army diverted its course after failing to advance against Satakarni. According to Alain Dani√©lou, Kharavela was friendly with Satakarni, and only crossed his kingdom without any clashes.\nSatakarni's successor Satakarni II ruled for 56 years, during which he captured eastern Malwa from the Shungas. This allowed him access to the Buddhist site of Sanchi, in which he is credited with the building of the decorated gateways around the original Mauryan Empire and Sunga stupas. Satakarni II is known from a dedicatory inscription at Sanchi. He was succeeded by Lambodara. The coins of Lambodara's son and successor Apilaka have been found in eastern Madhya Pradesh. However, Andrew Ollett argues that there is only one Satakarni, as the alleged first Satakarni is assigned ten years, and the second, fifty years by other scholars, but the only dated inscription of this king is Candankheda seal from his reign's year 30, around 60 BCE, and he ruled ca. 88‚Äì42 BCE.\n\n\n==== Art of Sanchi ====\nThe Satavahanas contributed greatly to the embellishment of the Buddhist stupa of Sanchi. It was heavily repaired under King Satakarni II. The gateways and the balustrade were built after 70 BCE, and appear to have been commissioned by the Satavahanas.  An inscription on the Southern Gateway records that it was the work of Satakarni II's royal architect Ananda. An inscription records the gift of one of the top architraves of the Southern Gateway by the artisans of the Satavahana Emperor Satakarni:\n\nGift of Ananda, the son of Vasithi, the foreman of the artisans of rajan Siri Satakarni\n\n\n=== First Western Satraps invasion under Nahapana ===\n\nLittle is known about Apilaka's successors, except cryptic references to one Kuntala Satakarni. The next well-known ruler of the dynasty was HƒÅla, who composed Gaha Sattasai in Maharashtri Prakrit. Like Hala, his four successors also ruled for very short periods (a total of 12 years), indicating troubled times for the Satavahanas.\nEpigraphic and numismatic evidence suggests that the Satavahanas earlier controlled the northern Deccan Plateau, the northern Konkan coastal plains, and the mountain passes connecting these two regions. During 15‚Äì40 CE, their northern neighbours ‚Äì the Western Kshatrapas ‚Äì extended their influence into these regions. The Western Kshatrapa ruler Nahapana is known to have ruled the former Satavahana territory, as attested by the inscriptions of his governor and son-in-law, Rishabhadatta.\n\n\n=== First revival ===\n\nThe Satavahana power was revived by Gautamiputra Satakarni, who is considered the greatest of the Satavahana rulers. Charles Higham dates his reign c.‚Äâ103 ‚Äì c.‚Äâ127 CE. S. Nagaraju dates it 106‚Äì130 CE, the new consensus is shared by Shailendra Bhandare, Akira Shimada, and Oskar von Hinuber, who regard Gautamiputra Satakarni's reign was ca. 60‚Äì85 CE, as it is evident from history that \"Gautamiputra Saatakarni\" in the year 78 CE defeated Vikramaditya of Ujjain, which in turn was celebrated and named \"Yug Aadi\" means Beginning of New Era (New Year for Andhra, Karnataka, Maharashtra (Gudi padwa), Telangana states). Ever since these states people followed  Saatavaahana calendar. Andrew Ollett considers it as 60‚Äì84 CE. The king defeated by him appears to have been the Western Kshatrapa ruler Nahapana, as suggested by Nahapana's coins overstuck with names and titles of Gautamiputra. The Nashik prashasti inscription of Gautamiputra's mother Gautami Balashri, dated to the 20th year after his death, records his achievements. The most liberal interpretation of the inscription suggests that his kingdom extended from the present-day Rajasthan in the north to Krishna river in the south, and from Saurashtra in the west to Kalinga in the east. He assumed the titles Raja-Raja (King of Kings) and Maharaja (Great King), and was described as the Lord of Vindhya.\nDuring the last years of his reign, his administration was apparently handled by his mother, which could have been a result of an illness or military preoccupation. According to the Nasik inscription made by his mother Gautami Balashri, he was the one ...\n\n‚Ä¶ who crushed down the pride and conceit of the Kshatriyas; who destroyed the Sakas (Western Satraps), Yavanas (Indo-Greeks) and Pahlavas (Indo-Parthians),... who rooted out the Khakharata family (the Kshaharata family of Nahapana); who restored the glory of the Satavahana race.\nGautamiputra was succeeded by his son Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi (or Pulumayi). According to Sailendra Nath Sen, Pulumavi ruled from 96 to 119 CE. According to Charles Higham, he ascended the throne around 110 CE, according to Shailendra Bhandare, Akira Shimada, and Oskar von Hinuber Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi ruled ca. 85‚Äì125 CE, and Andrew Ollett considers it to be ca. 84‚Äì119 CE. Pulumavi features in a large number of Satavahana inscriptions and his coins have been found distributed over a wide area. This indicates that he maintained Gautamiputra's territory, and ruled a prosperous kingdom. He is believed to have added the Bellary region to Satakarni's kingdom. His coins featuring ships with double mast have been found on the Coromandel Coast, indicating involvement in maritime trade and naval power. The old stupa at Amaravati was perhaps renovated during his reign. though recent scholarship tends to spread the dates of this wider.\n\n\n=== Second Western Satraps invasion under Rudradaman I ===\n\nPulumavi's successor was his brother Vashishtiputra Satakarni. According to S. N. Sen he ruled during 120‚Äì149 CE; according to Charles Higham, his regnal years spanned 138‚Äì145 CE. He entered into a marriage alliance with the Western Satraps, marrying the daughter of Rudradaman I.\nThe Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman I states that he defeated Satakarni, the lord of Dakshinapatha (Deccan), twice. It also states that he spared the life of the defeated ruler because of close relations:\n\n\"Rudradaman (...) who obtained good report because he, in spite of having twice in fair fight completely defeated Satakarni, the lord of Dakshinapatha, on account of the nearness of their connection did not destroy him.\"\nAccording to D. R. Bhandarkar and Dineshchandra Sircar, the ruler defeated by Rudradaman was Gautamiputra Satakarni. However, E. J. Rapson believed that the defeated ruler was his son Vasishthiputra Pulumavi. Shailendra Nath Sen and Charles Higham believe that the defeated ruler was Vashishtiputra's successor Shivaskanda or Shiva Sri Pulumayi (or Pulumavi).\nAs a result of his victories, Rudradaman regained all the former territories previously held by Nahapana, except for the extreme south territories of Pune and Nasik. Satavahana dominions were limited to their original base in the Deccan and eastern central India around Amaravati.\n\n\n=== Second revival ===\n\nSri Yajna SƒÅtakarni, the last person belonging to the main Satavahana dynastic line, briefly revived the Satavahana rule. According to S. N. Sen, he ruled during 170‚Äì199 CE. Charles Higham dates the end of his reign to 181 CE. His coins feature images of ships, which suggest naval and marine trade success. Wide distribution of his coins, and inscriptions at Nashik, Kanheri and Guntur indicate that his rule extended over both eastern and western parts of Deccan. He recovered much of the territory lost the Western Kshatrapas, and issued silver coinage, imitating them. During the last years of his reign, the Abhiras captured the northern parts of the kingdom, around Nashik region.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAfter Yajna Satakarni, the dynasty was soon extinguished following the rise of its feudatories, perhaps on account of a decline in central power. On the other hand, the Western Satraps would continue to prosper for the next two centuries, until their extinction by the Gupta Empire. Yajna Sri was succeeded by Madhariputra Swami Isvarasena. The next king Vijaya ruled for 6 years. His son Vasishthiputra Sri Chadha Satakarni ruled for 10 years. Pulumavi IV, the last king of the main line, ruled until c.‚Äâ225 CE. During his reign, several Buddhist monuments were constructed at sites including Nagarjunakonda and Amaravati. Madhya Pradesh was also part of his kingdom.\nAfter the death of Pulumavi IV, the Satavahana empire fragmented into five smaller kingdoms:\n\nNorthern part, ruled by a collateral branch of the Satavahanas (which ended in early 4th century)\nWestern part around Nashik, ruled by the Abhira dynasty\nEastern part (Krishna-Guntur region), ruled by the Andhra Ikshvakus\nSouth-western parts (northern Karanataka), ruled by the Chutus of Banavasi\nSouth-eastern part, ruled by the Pallavas\n\n\n== Territorial extent ==\n\nThe Satavahana territory included northern Deccan region, spanning the present-day Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana states. At times, their rule also extended to present-day Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. The Nashik prashasti inscription issued by Gautami Balashri, the mother of Gautamiputra Satakarni, claims that her son ruled an extensive territory that stretched from Gujarat in the north to northern Karnataka in the south. It is not clear if Gautamiputra had effective control over these claimed territories. In any case, historical evidence suggests that his control over these territories did not last long. Moreover, this realm was not continuous: many areas in this region remained under the control of the hunter-gatherers and other tribal communities.\nAs per historian M. Govinda Pai, Ptolemy (100‚Äì170 CE) states that when Siro Polemaios (Vasishthiputra Sri Pulumayi) was ruling from his capital Paithan in the north (reign c. 85-125 CE), another Satavahana prince called Baleokouros or Baleokoura (Vilivayakura) was ruling from Hippokoura (Huvina Hipparagi) of Basavana Bagewadi taluk of Vijayapura district of present Karnataka in the south who was none other than his own son. Pai identifies this prince Vilivaya-kura as another form of Vilivaya Kumara (meaning the son of Vilivaya), and he goes on to prove that Vilivaya is indeed merely another rendering of Pulumayi which was transformed as per Prakrit rules, the spoken form of this language during that period, and due to common parlance. Thus, Vilivayakura means a son of Pulumayi who was ruling from Huvina Hipparagi in present Karnataka. Pai identifies all the 10 cities mentioned by Ptolemy as lying between the river Benda (or Binda) or Bhima river in the north and Banaouasei (Banavasi) in the south, viz. Nagarouris (Nagur), Tabaso (Tavasi), Inde (Indi), Tiripangalida (Gadhinglaj), Hippokoura (Huvina Hipparagi), Soubouttou (Savadi), Sirimalaga (Malkhed), Kalligeris (Kalkeri), Modogoulla (Mudgal) and Petirgala (Pattadakal), as being located in Northern Karnataka.\nThe Satavahana capital kept shifting with time. The Nashik inscription describes Gautamiputra as the lord of Benakataka, suggesting that this was the name of his capital. Ptolemy (2nd century CE) mentioned Pratishthana (modern Paithan) as the capital of Pulumavi. At other times, the Satavahana capitals included Dharanikota and Junnar. M. K. Dhavalikar theorised that the original Satavahana capital was located at Junnar, but had to be moved to Pratishthana because of Saka-Kushana incursions from the north-west.\nSeveral Satavahana-era inscriptions record grants to religious monasteries. The settlements most frequently mentioned as the residences of donors in these inscriptions include the sea ports of Sopara, Kalyan, Bharuch, Kuda (unidentified), and Chaul. The most frequently mentioned inland settlements include Dhanyakatakam/Dharanikota, Junnar, Nashik, Paithan, and Karad.\nOther important Satavahana sites in western Deccan include Govardhana, Nevasa, Ter, and Vadgaon-Madhavpur. The ones in eastern Deccan include Amaravati, Dhulikatta, Kotalingala and Peddabankur.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nThe Satavahanas followed the administration guidelines of the Shastras. Their government was less top-heavy than that of the Mauryans, and featured several levels of feudatories:\n\nRajan, the hereditary rulers\nRajas, petty princes who struck coins in their own names\nMaharathis, hereditary lords who could grant villages in their own names and maintained matrimonial relations with the ruling family\nMahabhojas\nMahasenapati (civil administrator under Pulumavi II; governor of a janapada under Pulumavi IV)\nMahatalavara (\"great watchman\")\nThe royal princes (kumaras) were appointed as viceroys of the provinces.\nThe ahara appears to have been the largest geographical subdivision of the Satavahana polity. Several inscriptions refer to aharas named after the governors appointed to rule them (e.g. Govardhanahara, Mamalahara, Satavanihara and Kapurahara). This suggests that the Satavahanas attempted to build a formal administrative and revenue collection structure.\nThe inscriptions of Gautamiputra Satakarni suggest the existence of a bureaucratic structure, although it is not certain how stable and effective this structure was. For example, two inscriptions from Nashik Cave 11 record donations of agricultural land to ascetic communities. They state that the ascetics would enjoy tax exemption and non-interference from the royal officials. The first inscription states that the grant was approved by Gautamiputra's minister Sivagupta on the king's verbal orders, and preserved by the \"great lords\". The second inscription records a grant by Gautamiputra and his mother, and mentions Syamaka as the minister of the Govardhana ahara. It states that the charter was approved by a woman named Lota, who according to archaeologist James Burgess' interpretation, was the chief lady-in-waiting of Gautamiputra's mother.\nThe Satavahana-era inscriptions mention three types of settlements: nagara (city), nigama (market town) and gƒÅma (village).\nAccording to Sastri, \"the Satavahanas were described as 'lords of the three oceans' and promoted overseas colonization and trade. Under them, Buddhist art attained the superb forms of beauty and elegance preserved to this day in the cave-temples of western India and the survivals from the stupa of Amaravati, Goli, Nagarjunikonda\". This tradition was followed by successors of Satavahana in the eastern and western Deccan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Satavahanas participated in (and benefited from) economic expansion through intensification of agriculture, increased production of other commodities, and trade within and beyond the Indian subcontinent.\nDuring the Satavahana period, several large settlements emerged in the fertile areas, especially along the major rivers. The amount of land under agricultural use also expanded significantly, as a result of forest clearance and construction of irrigation reservoirs.\nThe exploitation of sites with mineral resources may have increased during the Satavahana period, leading to the emergence of new settlements in these areas. Such sites facilitated commerce and crafts (such as ceramic ware). The increased craft production during the Satavahana period is evident from archaeological discoveries at sites such as Kotalingala, as well as epigraphic references to artisans and guilds.\nThe Satavahanas controlled the Indian sea coast, and as a result, they dominated the growing Indian trade with the Roman Empire. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions two important Satavahana trade centres: Pratishthana and Tagara. Other important urban centres included Kondapur, Banavasi and Madhavpur. Nanaghat was the site of an important pass that linked the Satavahana capital Pratishthana to the sea.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nThe Satavahanas patronized Brahmanism and Mahayana Buddhism, performed Vedic sacrifices, and claimed Brahmanical status. They also made generous donations to Buddhist monasteries. The lay people in the Satavahana period perhaps generally did not exclusively support a particular religious group .\nThe Naneghat inscription of Nayanika, recorded on the walls of a cave, mentions that her husband Satakarni I performed several Vedic sacrifices, including ashvamedha (horse sacrifice), rajasuya (royal consecration), and agnyadheya (fire ceremony). The inscription also records substantial fees paid to Brahmin priests and attendees for these sacrifices. For example, 10,001 cows were granted for the Bhagala-Dasaratra sacrifice; and 24,400 coins were granted for another sacrifice, whose name is not clear.\nA number of Buddhist monastic sites emerged in the Deccan region during the Satavahana period. However, the exact relations between these monasteries and the Satavahana government is not clear. The Pandavleni Caves inscription issued during the reign of Kanha states that the cave was excavated by maha-matra (officer-in-charge) of the shramanas (non-Vedic ascetics). Based on this, Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya concludes that Kanha favoured Buddhism, and had an administrative department dedicated to the welfare of Buddhist monks. The most common among donors were merchants, and many of the monasteries were located along the important trade routes. The merchants probably donated to the monasteries, because these sites facilitated trade by serving as rest houses, and possibly by directly participating in the trade. The monasteries appear to have been an important venue for displaying charitable donations, including the donations made to non-Buddhists (especially Brahmins).\n\n\n== Language ==\nMost of the known Satavahana inscriptions and coin legends are in a Middle Indo-Aryan language. This language has been termed \"Prakrit\", defined broadly to include every Middle Indo-Aryan language that is \"not exactly Sanskrit\". The language of the inscriptions is actually closer to Sanskrit than to the literary Prakrit, Maharashtri Prakrit, used in the Gaha Sattasai anthology. \nConsidered an ancestor language of modern Marathi, Maharashtri Prakrit was adopted as a courtly, or official, language by the Satavahana dynasty.  \nThe Satvahanas also used Sanskrit in political inscriptions, but this was rare. A fragmentary inscription found close to the Nashik prashasti of Gautamiputra Satakarni uses Sanskrit verses in vasanta-tilaka metre to describe a deceased king (probably Gautamiputra). A Sanskrit inscription found at Sannati probably refers to Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni, one of whose coins also features a Sanskrit legend.\nAccording to Gunadhya, besides Sanskrit and Prakrit there is another language called 'Desi' which may mean the native language or the language of common man. Commenting on the Desi language Dr.D.C.Sircar remarks \"It was apparently Early Telugu which was in older times very much closer to Tamil than it is now was the mother tongue of the common people\". Later Satavahana kings like Gauthamiputra Satakarni, Vastistiputra pulamovi and Yajna Satakarni had their names in two languages i.e.; Prakrit and Desi (possibly Old Tamil), a native language.\nThe Satavahanas also issued bilingual coins featuring Middle Indo-Aryan language on one side, and Desi language (possibly Old Tamil) on the other.\n\n\n== Inscriptions ==\n\nSeveral Brahmi script inscriptions are available from the Satavahana period, but most of these record donations to Buddhist institutions by individuals, and do not provide much information about the dynasty. The inscriptions issued by the Satavahana royals themselves also primarily concern religious donations, although some of them provide some information about the rulers and the imperial structure.\nThe earliest extant Satavahana inscription is from Nashik Cave 19, which states that the cave was commissioned by Mahamatra Saman of Nashik during the reign of king Kanha.\nAt Naneghat, an inscription issued by Nayanika, the widow of Satakarni I, has been found. It records Nayanika's lineage and mentions the Vedic sacrifices performed by the royal family. Another inscription at Naneghat comprises names of Satavahana royals, appearing as labels over their bas-relief portraits. The portraits are now completely eroded, but the inscription is believed to be contemporary to Nayanika's inscription on a paleographic basis.\nThe next oldest Satavahana-era inscription appears on a sculpted gateway element of Stupa 1 at Sanchi. It states that the element was donated by Ananda, who was the son of Siri Satakarni's foreman of artisans. This inscription is probably from the reign of Satakarni II.\n\n\n== Coinage ==\n\nThe Satavahanas were the earliest Indian rulers to issue their own coins with portraits of their rulers, starting with king Gautamiputra Satakarni, a practice derived from that of the Western Kshatrapas he defeated. The Western Satraps themselves had been following the features of the coins of the Indo-Greek kings to the northwest.\nThousands of lead, copper and potin Satavahana coins have been discovered in the Deccan region; a few gold and silver coins are also available. These coins do not feature uniform design or size, and suggest that multiple minting locations existed within the Satavahana territory, leading to regional differences in coinage.\nThe coin legends of the Satavahanas, in all areas and all periods, used a Prakrit dialect without exception. In addition, some reverse coin legends are in Dravidian (much more similar to Tamil than Telugu, in the Dravidian script (similar to the Brahmi script apart from a few variations).\nSeveral coins carry titles or matronyms that were common to multiple rulers (e.g. Satavahana, Satakarni, and Pulumavi), so the number of rulers attested by coinage cannot be determined with certainty. The names of 16 to 20 rulers appear on the various coins. Some of these rulers appear to be local elites rather than the Satavahana monarchs.\nThe Satavahana coins give unique indications as to their chronology, language, and even facial features (curly hair, long ears and strong lips). They issued mainly lead and copper coins; their portrait-style silver coins were usually struck over coins of the Western Kshatrapa kings. The Satavahana coins also display various traditional symbols, such as elephants, lions, horses and chaityas (stupas), as well as the \"Ujjain symbol\", a cross with four circles at the end.\n\n\n=== Other examples ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cultural achievements ==\n\nThe Satavahanas patronised the Prakrit language instead of Sanskrit. The Satavahana king HƒÅla is famous for compiling the collection of Maharashtri poems known as the Gaha Sattasai (Sanskrit: GƒÅthƒÅ Saptashatƒ´), although from linguistic evidence it seems that the work now extant must have been re-edited in the succeeding century or two. Through this book, it was evident that agriculture was the main means of livelihood. Also many sorts of superstitions had prevailed. Additionally, Gunadhya, the minister of Hala, was the author of Brihatkatha.\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nMadhukar Keshav Dhavalikar writes that \"The Satavahana sculptures unfortunately has never been recognized as an independent school in spite of the fact it has its own distinctive characteristic features. The earliest in point of time is that in the Bhaja Vihara cave which marks the beginning of sculptural art in the Satavahana dominion around 200BC. It is profusely decorated with carvings, and even pillars have a lotus capital crowned with sphinx-like mythic animals.\" Dhavalikar also writes that in Chankama \"the panel occurring on the west pillar of Northern Gateway portrays a very important event in Buddha's life. It depicts votaries, two each on either side of what looks like a ladder which actually is the promenade which Buddha is supposed to have walked. It is said that Buddha, after attaining Enlightment, spent four weeks near the Bodhi tree. Of these, the third week he spent walking along the promenade (chankama) to and fro.\"\nAlong with some of the above major Satavahana sculptures some more sculptures existed‚Äînamely, Dvarapala, Gajalaksmi, Shalabhanjikas, Royal Procession, Decorative pillar, etc.\n\n\n=== Bronze ===\n\nSeveral metal figurines are found that could be attributed to the Satavahanas. A hoard of unique bronze objects were also found from Bramhapuri. Numerous articles obtained from there were Indian but also reflected Roman and Italian influence. A small statue of Poseidon, wine jugs, and a plaque depicting Perseus and Andromeda were also obtained from the house from where the objects were found. The fine elephant in the Ashmolean Museum, the Yaksi image in the British Museum, and the cornucopia found in Posheri, kept at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya can also be attributed to the Satavahana period.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe sculptures of the Amaravati Stupa and the wider Amaravati style represent the architectural development of the Satavahana periods. They built Buddhist stupas in Amravati (95 feet high). They also constructed a large number of stupas at Goli, Jaggiahpeta, Ghantasala, Amaravati Bhattiprolu, and Shri Parvatam. Caves IX and X, containing Ajanta paintings, were patronised by Satavahana, and the painting throughout the caves appear to have started with them. Ashokan Stupas were enlarged, the earlier bricks and wood works being replaced with stone works. The most famous of these monuments are the stupas, the most famous among them being the Amravati Stupa and the Nagarjunakonda Stupa.\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\nThe Satavahana paintings are the earliest surviving specimens‚Äîexcluding prehistoric rock art‚Äîin India, and they are to be found only at the Ajanta Caves. There were two phases of artistic activity of Ajanta: the first occurring in the 2nd to 1st centuries BCE, when Hinayana caves were excavated during Satavahana rule; the later in the second half of the 5th century under the Vakatakas. Vagaries of nature and some vandalism have taken a heavy toll on the Ajanta Caves. Only a few fragments related to the Satavahanas have survived in Caves No. 9 and 10, both of which are chaitya-grihas with stupas.\nThe most important surviving painting of the Satavahana period at Ajanta is the Chhadanta Jataka in Cave No. 10, but that, too, is only fragmentary. It is a painting of an elephant named Bodhisattva with six tusks, related to a mythological story. The human figures, both male and female, are typically Satavahanas, almost identical with their counterparts on the Sanchi Gateways so far as their physiognomy, costumes, and jewellery are concerned. The only difference is that the Sanchi figures have shed some of their weight.\n\n\n=== Art of Amaravati ===\n\nThe Satavahana rulers are also remarkable for their contributions to Buddhist art and architecture. They built great stupas in the Krishna River Valley, including the stupa at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh. The stupas were decorated in marble slabs and sculpted with subjects including scenes from the life of the Buddha, portrayed in a characteristic slim and elegant style. The regional Amaravati style of sculpture also influenced the sculpture of Southeast Asia.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== List of rulers ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagadha\nHistory of Maharashtra\nHistory of India\nHistory of Hinduism\nList of Indian monarchs\nList of wars involving India\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Satavahana at Wikimedia Commons",
      "summary": "The Satavahanas (; SƒÅdavƒÅhana or SƒÅtavƒÅhana, IAST: SƒÅtavƒÅhana), also referred to as the Andhras (also Andhra-bh·πõtyas or Andhra-jatiyas) in the Puranas, were an ancient Indian dynasty. Most modern scholars believe that the Satavahana rule began in the late 2nd century BCE and lasted until the early 3rd century CE, although some assign the beginning of their rule to as early as the 3rd century BCE based on the Puranas, but uncorroborated by archaeological evidence. The Satavahana kingdom mainly comprised the present-day Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. At different times, their rule extended to parts of modern Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka. The dynasty had different capital cities at different times, including Pratishthana (Paithan) and Amaravati (Dharanikota).\nThe origin of the dynasty is uncertain, but according to the Puranas, their first king overthrew the Kanva dynasty. In the post-Maurya era, the Satavahanas established peace in the Deccan region and resisted the onslaught of foreign invaders. In particular their struggles with the Saka (Western Satraps) went on for a long time. The dynasty reached its zenith under the rule of Gautamiputra Satakarni and his successor Vasisthiputra Pulamavi. The kingdom had fragmented into smaller states by the early 3rd century CE.\nThe Satavahanas were early issuers of Indian state coinage struck with images of their rulers. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade and the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.\n\n",

      "title": "Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani",
      "content": "Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani (Persian: ŸÖ€åÿ± ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿπŸÑ€å ŸáŸÖÿØÿßŸÜ€å; c.‚Äâ1312‚Äì1385 CE) was a Sufi saint of the Kubrawiya order, who played an important role in the spread of Islam in the Kashmir Valley. He was born in Hamadan, Iran, and preached Islam in Central Asia and South Asia. He died in Swat on his way from Srinagar to Mecca and was buried in Khatlan, Tajikistan, in 1385 CE, aged 71‚Äì72. Hamadani was also addressed honorifically throughout his life as the ShƒÅh-e-HamadƒÅn (\"King of Hamadan\"), Amƒ´r-i Kabƒ´r (\"the Great Commander\"), and Ali Sani (\"second Ali\").\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHis title, Sayyid, indicates that he was a descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, possibly from both sides of his family.\nHamadani spent his early years under the tutelage of Ala ad-Daula Simnani, a famous Kubrawiya saint from Semnan, Iran,  the first of the Sufis to criticize the teachings of the School of Ibn `Arabƒ´ in general, and the concept of \"oneness of being\" (wa·∏•dat al-wuj≈´d) in particular. As a successor of SimnƒÅnƒ´, HamadƒÅnƒ´ was an heir to this debate, and AsrƒÅr al-Nuq·π≠ah must be viewed in this context.\n\n\n== Travels ==\nSayyid Ali Hamadani travelled widely and preached Islam in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, China, Syria, India (Kashmir), and Turkestan.\nThe third visit of Sayyid Ali was caused by the third invasion of Persia by Timur in 1383, when he conquered Iraq and decided to oust the Alid Sayyids of Hamadan, who, until his time, had played an important part in local affairs. Sayyid Ali, therefore, left Hamadan with 700 Sayyids and set out towards Kashmir, where he expected to be safe from the wrath of Timur. He had already sent two of his followers, Syed Taj ad-din Semnani and Mir Syed Hasan Semnani, to take stock of the situation. Shib ad-Din became a follower of Mir Syed Hasan Semnani, and so Hamadani was welcomed in Kashmir by the king and his heir apparent Qutbu'd-Din Shah. At that time, the Kashmiri ruler, Qutub ad-Din Shah, was at war with Firuz Shah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi, but Hamadani brokered a peace. Hamdani stayed in Kashmir for six months. After Sharaf-ad-Din Abdul Rehman Bulbul Shah, Hamadani was the second important Muslim to visit Kashmir. Hamadani went to Mecca and then returned to Kashmir in 1379/80 CE, during the reign of Qutub ad-Din, and spent a year spreading Islam in Kashmir before returning to Turkestan via Ladakh in 1381/82 CE. He returned to Kashmir for the third time in 1383/84 CE to stay for a longer period, but had to return earlier owing to illness. Hamadani died on his way back to Central Asia at a site close to the present-day town of Mansehra in North-West Pakistan. His body was carried by his disciples to Kulab, Tajikistan, where his shrine is located.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nHistorical Eidgah Srinagar is also known as Eidgah Shah-i-Hamdan. Hamadani started organized efforts to convert Kashmir to Islam. Hamadani is regarded as having brought various crafts and industries from Iran into India, notably carpet weaving; it is said that he brought 700 Sayyids with him to the country.\nThe growth of the textile industry in Kashmir increased its demand for fine wool, which in turn meant that Kashmiri Muslim groups settled in Ladakh, bringing with them skills such as minting and literary writing.\nHamadani wrote a book on politics, governance, and social bhaviour, called the Zakhirat ul-Muluk.\n\n\n== Works ==\nOne manuscript (Raza Library, Rampur, 764; copied 929/1523) contains eleven works ascribed to Hamadani (whose silsila runs to Naw'i Khabushani; the manuscript contains two documents associated with him).\n\nRisalah Nooriyah\nRisalah Maktubaat\nDur Mu‚Äôrifati Surat wa Sirat-i-Insaan\nDur Haqaa‚Äôiki Tawbah\nHallil Nususi allal Fusus\nSharhi Qasidah Khamriyah Fariziyah\nRisalatul Istalahaat\nilmul Qiyafah or Risalah-i qiyafah\nDah Qa‚Äôidah\nKitabul Mawdah Fil Qurba\nKitabus Sab‚Äôina Fi Fadha‚Äôil Amiril Mu‚Äôminin\nArba‚Äôina Amiriyah\nRawdhtul\nAwraad-ul-Fatehah\nChahal Asrar (Forty Secrets)\nZakhirat-ul-Muluk\nSyed Abdur-Rehman Hamdani, in his book Salar-e-Ajjam, lists 68 books and 23 pamphlets by Sayyid Ali Hamadani.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJohn Renard 2005: Historical Dictionary of Sufism (Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies and Movements, 58), ISBN 0810853426",

      "title": "History of India (1947‚Äìpresent)",
      "content": "The history of independent India or history of Republic of India began when the country became an independent sovereign state within the British Commonwealth on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, affected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries‚ÄîIndia, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims. Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the Partition of India. The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The constitution adopted in 1950 made India a democratic republic with Westminster style parliamentary system of government, both at federal and state level respectively. The  democracy has been sustained since then. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newly independent states.\nThe country has faced religious violence, naxalism, terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China which escalated into a war in 1962 and 1967, and with Pakistan which resulted in wars in 1947‚Äì1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999. India was neutral in the Cold War, and was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. However, it made a loose alliance with the Soviet Union from 1971, when Pakistan was allied with the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, having conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, followed by another five tests in 1998. From the 1950s to the 1980s, India followed socialist-inspired policies. The economy was influenced by extensive regulation, protectionism and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow economic growth. Since 1991, India has pursued more economic liberalisation. Today, India is the third largest and one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nFrom being a relatively struggling country in its formative years, the Republic of India has emerged as a fast growing G20 major economy. India has sometimes been referred to as a great power and a potential superpower given its large and growing economy, military and population.\n\n\n== 1947‚Äì1950: Dominion of India ==\n\nIndependent India's first years were marked with turbulent events‚Äîa massive exchange of population with Pakistan, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the integration of over 500 princely states to form a united nation. Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi also ensured that the constitution of independent India would be secular.\n\n\n=== Partition of India ===\n\nThe partition of India was outlined in the Indian Independence Act 1947. It led to the dissolution of the British Raj in South Asia and the creation of two independent dominions: India and Pakistan. The change of political borders notably included the division of two provinces of British India, Bengal and Punjab. The majority Muslim districts in these provinces were awarded to Pakistan and the majority non-Muslim to India. The other assets that were divided included the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Royal Indian Air Force, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury. Self-governing independent Pakistan and India legally came into existence at midnight on 14 and 15 August 1947 respectively.The partition caused large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration between the two dominions. Among refugees who survived, it solidified the belief that safety lay among co-religionists. In the instance of Pakistan, it made palpable a hitherto only-imagined refuge for the Muslims of British India. The migrations took place hastily and with little warning. It is thought that between 14 million and 18 million people moved, and perhaps more. Excess mortality during the period of the partition is usually estimated to have been around one million. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that affects their relationship to this day.\nAn estimated 3.5 million Hindus and Sikhs living in West Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, East Bengal and Sind migrated to India in fear of domination and suppression in Muslim Pakistan. Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their Punjab and Bengal boundaries, and the cities of Calcutta, Delhi and Lahore. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of Mohandas Gandhi, the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a fast-unto-death in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the Indian Army was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\n\nI find no parallel in history for a body of converts and their descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock.\nThe assassination of Mohandas Gandhi on 30 January 1948 was carried out by Nathuram Godse, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\n\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan, owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\n\n\n=== Integration of princely states ===\n\nIn July 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, Nehru said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings. In May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. British India consisted of 17 provinces, which existed alongside 565 princely states. The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in two particular cases‚ÄîPunjab and Bengal‚Äîafter being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or accede to either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented country with independent states and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made Rajpramukh (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as Saurashra, PEPSU, Vindhya Pradesh and Madhya Bharat. Some princely states such as Tripura and Manipur acceded later in 1949.\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\n\nJunagadh (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab)‚Äîa December 1947 plebiscite resulted in a 99% vote to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the Nawab against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly Hindu and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.\nHyderabad (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)‚ÄîPatel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the Nizam, code-named Operation Polo, after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13 and 29 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir (a Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the First Indo-Pakistani War which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. Jawaharlal Nehru initially agreed to Mountbatten's proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 January 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state.\n\n\n=== Constitution ===\n\nThe Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950. The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395. The constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity. Key features of the constitution were Universal suffrage for all adults,Westminster style parliamentary system of government at the federal and state level, and independent judiciary. The constitution also required the Union Government and the States and Territories of India to set reserved quotas or seats, at particular percentage in  Education Admissions, Employments, Political Bodies, Promotions, etc., for \"socially and educationally backward citizens.\" The constitution has had more than 100 amendments since it was enacted.\nIndia celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.\n\n\n=== Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948 ===\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948 was fought between India and Pakistan over the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948. It was the first of four Indo-Pakistan Wars fought between the two newly independent nations. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal lashkar (militia) from Waziristan, in an effort to secure Kashmir, the future of which hung in the balance. A  United Nations-mediated ceasefire took place on 5 January 1949.\nIndian losses in the war totalled 1,104 killed and 3,154 wounded; Pakistani, about 6,000 killed and 14,000 wounded.\nNeutral assessments state India emerged victorious as it successfully defended the majority of the contested territory.\n\n\n== Governance and politics ==\nIndia held its first national elections under the Constitution in 1952, where a turnout of over 60% was recorded. The Indian National Congress won an overwhelming majority, and Jawaharlal Nehru began a second term as prime minister. President Prasad was also elected to a second term by the electoral college of the first Parliament of India.\n\n\n=== Nehru administration (1952‚Äì1964) ===\nNehru can be regarded as the founder of the modern Indian state. Parekh attributes this to the national philosophy Nehru formulated for India. For him, modernisation was the national philosophy, with seven goals: national unity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, socialism, development of the scientific temper, and non-alignment. In Parekh's opinion, the philosophy and the policies that resulted from this benefited a large section of society such as public sector workers, industrial houses, and middle and upper peasantry. However, it failed to benefit or satisfy the urban and rural poor, the unemployed and the Hindu fundamentalists.\nThe death of Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950 left Nehru as the sole remaining iconic national leader, and soon the situation became such that Nehru could implement his vision for India  without hindrance.\nNehru implemented economic policies based on import substitution industrialisation and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector would co-exist with the private sector. He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public sector industries‚Äîsteel, iron, coal, and power‚Äîpromoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies.\n\nNehru led the Congress to further election victories in 1957 and 1962. During his tenure, the Indian Parliament passed extensive reforms that increased the legal rights of women in Hindu society, and further legislated against caste discrimination and untouchability. Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India's children to complete primary education, and thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, were founded across the nation. Nehru advocated a socialist model for the economy of India. After India achieved independence, a formal model of planning was adopted, and accordingly the Planning Commission, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, was established in 1950, with Nehru as the chairman. The commission was tasked with formulating Five-Year Plans for economic development which were shaped by the Soviet model based on centralised and integrated national economic programs‚Äîno taxation for Indian farmers, minimum wage and benefits for blue-collar workers, and the nationalisation of heavy industries such as steel, aviation, shipping, electricity, and mining. Village common lands were seized, and an extensive public works and industrialisation campaign resulted in the construction of major dams, irrigation canals, roads, thermal and hydroelectric power stations, and many more.\n\n\n=== States reorganisation ===\n\nPotti Sreeramulu's fast-unto-death, and consequent death for the demand of an Andhra State in 1952 sparked a major re-shaping of the Indian Union. Nehru appointed the States Re-organisation Commission, upon whose recommendations the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956. Old states were dissolved and new states created on the lines of shared linguistic and ethnic demographics. The separation of Kerala and the Telugu-speaking regions of Madras State enabled the creation of an exclusively Tamil-speaking state of Tamil Nadu. On 1 May 1960, the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were created out of the bilingual Bombay State, and on 1 November 1966, the larger Punjab state was divided into the smaller, Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Haryanvi-speaking Haryana states.\n\n\n=== Development of a multi-party system ===\nIn pre-independence India, the main parties were the Congress and the Muslim league. There were also many other parties such as the Hindu mahasabha, Justice party, the Akali dal, the Communist party etc. during this period with limited or regional appeal. With the eclipse of the Muslim league due to partition, the Congress party was able to dominate  Indian politics during the 1950s. This started breaking down during the 60s and 70s.This period saw formation of many new parties. These included  those founded by former congress leaders such as the Swatantra party, many Socialist leaning parties, and  the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the political arm of the Hindu nationalist RSS.\n\n\n==== Swatantra Party ====\n\nOn 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, C. Rajagopalachari, along with Murari Vaidya of the newly established Forum of Free Enterprise (FFE) and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist leaning Nehru, announced the formation of the new Swatantra Party at a meeting in Madras. Conceived by disgruntled heads of former princely states such as the Raja of Ramgarh, the Maharaja of Kalahandi and the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, the party was conservative in character. Later, N. G. Ranga, K. M. Munshi, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa and the Maharaja of Patiala joined the effort. Rajagopalachari, Masani and Ranga also tried but failed to involve Jayaprakash Narayan in the initiative.\nIn his short essay \"Our Democracy\", Rajagopalachari argued the necessity of a right-wing alternative to the Congress:  \"since ... the Congress Party has swung to the Left, what is wanted is not an ultra or outer-Left [viz. the CPI or the Praja Socialist Party, PSP], but a strong and articulate Right.\" Rajagopalachari also said the opposition must: \"operate not privately and behind the closed doors of the party meeting, but openly and periodically through the electorate.\" He outlined the goals of the Swatantra Party through twenty-one \"fundamental principles\" in the foundation document. The party stood for equality and opposed government control over the private sector. Rajagopalachari sharply criticised the bureaucracy and coined the term \"licence-permit Raj\" to describe Nehru's elaborate system of permissions and licences required for an individual to set up a private enterprise. Rajagopalachari's personality became a rallying point for the party.\nRajagopalachari's efforts to build an anti-Congress front led to a patch-up with his former adversary C. N. Annadurai of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an alliance with the Swatantra Party for the 1962 Madras Legislative Assembly elections. Although there were occasional electoral pacts between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded. The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\n=== Foreign policy and military conflicts ===\n\nNehru's foreign policy was the inspiration of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which India was a co-founder. Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People's Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18‚Äì4 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet, and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute.\nIndia has fought a total of four wars/military conflicts with its neighbouring rival state Pakistan, two in this period. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, Pakistan captured one-third of Kashmir (which India claims as its territory), and India captured three-fifths (which Pakistan claims as its territory). In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India attacked Pakistan on all fronts by crossing the international border after attempts by Pakistani troops to infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir by crossing the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.\nIn 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of India.\nIn 1962 China and India engaged in the brief Sino-Indian War over the border in the Himalayas. The war was a complete rout for the Indians and led to a refocusing on arms build-up and an improvement in relations with the United States. China withdrew from disputed territory in the contested Chinese South Tibet and Indian North-East Frontier Agency that it crossed during the war. India disputes China's sovereignty over the smaller Aksai Chin territory that it controls on the western part of the Sino-Indian border.\n\n\n== 1960s after Nehru ==\n\nJawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964, and Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded him as prime minister. In 1965, India and Pakistan again went to war over Kashmir, but without any definitive outcome or alteration of the Kashmir boundary. The Tashkent Agreement was signed under the mediation of the Soviet government, but Shastri died on the night after the signing ceremony. A leadership election resulted in the elevation of Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter who had been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as the third prime minister. She defeated right-wing leader Morarji Desai. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation, and food crisis. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a devaluation of the rupee, which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\nIn 1967, India and China again engaged with each other in Sino-Indian War of 1967 after the PLA soldiers opened fire on the Indian soldiers who were making a fence on the border in Nathu La. The Indian forces successfully repelled Chinese forces and the outcome saw Chinese defeat with their withdrawal from Sikkim.\nMorarji Desai entered Gandhi's government as deputy prime minister and finance minister, and with senior Congress politicians attempted to constrain Gandhi's authority. But following the counsel of her political advisor P. N. Haksar, Gandhi resuscitated her popular appeal by a major shift towards socialist policies. She successfully ended the Privy Purse guarantee for former Indian royalty, and waged a major offensive against party hierarchy over the nationalisation of India's banks. Although resisted by Desai and India's business community, the policy was popular with the masses. When Congress politicians attempted to oust Gandhi by suspending her Congress membership, Gandhi was empowered with a large exodus of members of parliament to her own Congress (R). The bastion of the Indian freedom struggle, the Indian National Congress, had split in 1969. Gandhi continued to govern with a slim majority.\n\n\n== 1970s ==\n\nIn 1971, Indira Gandhi and her Congress (R) were returned to power with a massively increased majority. The nationalisation of banks was carried out, and many other socialist economic and industrial policies enacted. India intervened in the Bangladesh War of Independence, a civil war taking place in Pakistan's Bengali half, after millions of refugees had fled the persecution of the Pakistani army. The clash resulted in the independence of East Pakistan, which became known as Bangladesh, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's elevation to immense popularity. Relations with the United States grew strained, and India signed a 20-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union‚Äîbreaking explicitly for the first time from non-alignment. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear weapon in the desert of Rajasthan, near Pokhran.\n\n\n=== Merger of Sikkim ===\nIn 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in the Kingdom of Sikkim. In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards. Thereafter, a referendum was held in which 97.5 percent of voters supported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India.\nIndia is said to have stationed 20,000‚Äì40,000 troops in a country of only 200,000 during the referendum. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished. To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an \"associate state\", a special designation not used by any other state. A month later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.\n\n\n=== Formation of Northeastern states ===\nIn the Northeast India, the state of Assam was divided into several states beginning in 1970 within the borders of what was then Assam. In 1963, the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of Nagaland. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. In 1970, in response to the demands of the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo people of the Meghalaya Plateau, the districts embracing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state within Assam; in 1972 this became a separate state under the name of Meghalaya. In 1972, Arunachal Pradesh (the North-East Frontier Agency) and Mizoram (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam as union territories; both became states in 1986.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Green revolution and Operation Flood ===\n\nIndia's population passed the 500 million mark in the early 1970s, but its long-standing food crisis was resolved with greatly improved agricultural productivity due to the Green Revolution. The government sponsored modern agricultural implements, new varieties of generic seeds, and increased financial assistance to farmers that increased the yield of food crops such as wheat, rice and corn, as well as commercial crops like cotton, tea, tobacco and coffee. Increased agricultural productivity expanded across the states of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Punjab.\n\nUnder Operation Flood, the government encouraged the production of milk, which increased greatly, and improved rearing of livestock across India. This enabled India to become self-sufficient in feeding its own population, ending two decades of food imports.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh Liberation War ===\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was the third in four wars fought between the two nations. The war was fought in December 1971 over the issue of Bangladesh. India decisively defeated Pakistan, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh.\nThe crisis started with Punjabi dominated Pakistani army refusing to surrender power to the newly elected but mainly Bengali Awami League led by Shaikh Mujibur Rehman. Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence in march of 1971 by Rehman led to widespread atrocities being committed by the Pakistani army against select groups. It is estimated that starting in March 1971, members of the Pakistani military and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias killed between 300,000 and 3,000,000 civilians in Bangladesh. \nDuring the conflict, members of the Pakistani military and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias called the Razakars raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. The murders and rapes led to an estimated eight to ten million people to flee East Pakistan to seek refuge in India.\nOfficial de-jure war began with Pakistan airforce-affiliated Operation Chengiz Khan, which consisted of preemptive aerial strikes on 11 Indian air stations resulting in minor damages and suspension of counter-air operations for mere few hours. The strikes led to India declaring war on Pakistan, marking their entry into the war for East Pakistan's independence, on the side of Bengali nationalist forces. India's entry expanded the existing conflict with Indian and Pakistani forces engaging on both the eastern and western fronts. Thirteen days into the war, India had achieved total superiority into the East meanwhile it had sufficient superiority in the West, which resulted later in Eastern defence of Pakistan to sign a joint instrument of surrender. on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka, ending conflict officially and marking the formation of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh. Approximately 93,000 Pakistani servicemen were taken prisoner by the Indian Army, which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces, including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal to Pakistan. The remaining 10,324 to 12,500 prisoners were civilians, either family members of the military personnel or collaborators (Razakars).\n\n\n=== Indian Emergency ===\n\n\n==== Prelude to the Emergency ====\nIndia in the first half of the 1970s faced high inflation caused by the 1973 oil crisis which resulted in cost of oil imports to rise substantially, the cost of the Bangladesh war and the refugee resettlement, and food shortages caused by droughts in parts of the country. The economic and social problems caused by high inflation, as well as allegations of corruption against Indira Gandhi and her government, caused increasing political unrest across India during  1973‚Äì74. This included the Railway Strike in 1974, the Maoist Naxalite movement, the Bihar student agitations, the United Women's Anti- Price Rise Front in Maharashtra and the Nav Nirman movement in Gujarat.\nRaj Narain was the Samyukta Socialist Party Candidate and Indira's opponent in the 1971 Lok Sabha elections from Rai Bareli. Although he suffered a defeat from her in 1971 elections, he accused Indira Gandhi of corrupt electoral practices and filed an election petition against her. Four years later on 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court gave their verdict, and found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under Jaya Prakash Narayan to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi.\n\n\n==== Declaration of the emergency ====\nOn 25 June 1975, Gandhi advised President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a state of emergency under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many civil liberties and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned. Her government also introduced a contentious programme of compulsory birth control. Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\n\n\n==== Life during the emergency ====\nIndia's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and authoritarian conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's then twentynine year old son, and unofficial political advisor, Sanjay Gandhi, was accused of committing gross excesses‚ÄîSanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced vasectomies of men and sterilisation of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in Delhi near the Turkmen Gate, which left hundreds of  people dead or injured, and many more displaced.\n\n\n=== Janata interlude ===\n\nIndira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the Janata Party, an amalgamation of opposition parties. Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. The Desai administration established tribunals to investigate Emergency-era abuses, and Indira and Sanjay Gandhi were arrested after a report from the Shah Commission.\nIn 1979, the coalition crumbled and Charan Singh formed an interim government. The Janata Party had become intensely unpopular due to its internecine warfare, and a perceived lack of leadership on solving India's serious economic and social problems.\n\n\n== 1980s ==\n\nIndira Gandhi and her Congress Party splinter group, the Indian National Congress or simply \"Congress(I)\", were swept back into power with a large majority in January 1980.\nBut the rise of an insurgency in Punjab would jeopardise India's security. In Assam, there were many incidents of communal violence between native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as well as settlers from other parts of India. When Indian forces, undertaking Operation Blue Star, raided the hideout of self-rule pressing Khalistan militants in the Golden Temple ‚Äî Sikhs' most holy shrine ‚Äì in Amritsar, the inadvertent deaths of civilians and damage to the temple building inflamed tensions in the Sikh community across India. The Government used intensive police operations to crush militant operations, but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties. North-east India was paralysed owing to the ULFA's clash with Government forces.\n\nOn 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and 1984 anti-Sikh riots erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab, causing the deaths of thousands of Sikhs along with terrible pillage, arson, and rape. Senior members of the Congress Party have been implicated in stirring the violence against Sikhs. Government investigation has failed to date to discover the causes and punish the perpetrators, but public opinion blamed Congress leaders for directing attacks on Sikhs in Delhi.\n\n\n=== Rajiv Gandhi administration ===\nThe Congress party chose Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's older son, as the next prime minister. Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and prime minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination.\nRajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the Licence Raj was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves. As prime minister, Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation. Rajiv's encouragement of science and technology resulted in a major expansion of the telecommunications industry and India's space programme, and gave birth to the software industry and information technology sector.\nIn December 1984, gas leaked out at the Union Carbide pesticides plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal. Thousands were killed immediately, while many more subsequently died or were left disabled.\n\nIndia in 1987 brokered an agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka and agreed to deploy troops for peacekeeping operation in Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict led by the LTTE. Rajiv sent Indian troops to enforce the agreement and disarm the Tamil rebels, but the Indian Peace Keeping Force, as it was known, became entangled in outbreaks of violence, ultimately ending up fighting the Tamil rebels itself, and becoming a target of attack from Sri Lankan nationalists. V. P. Singh withdrew the IPKF in 1990, but thousands of Indian soldiers had died. Rajiv's departure from socialist policies did not sit well with the masses, who did not benefit from the innovations. Unemployment was a serious problem, and India's burgeoning population added ever-increasing needs for diminishing resources.\nRajiv Gandhi's image as an honest politician (he was nicknamed \"Mr. Clean\" by the press) was shattered when the Bofors scandal broke, revealing that senior government officials had taken bribes over defence contracts by a Swedish guns producer.\n\n\n=== Janata Dal ===\nGeneral elections in 1989 gave Rajiv's Congress a plurality, much less than the majority which propelled him to power.\n\nPower came instead to his former finance and defence minister, VP Singh of Janata Dal. Singh had been moved from the Finance ministry to the Defence ministry after he unearthed some scandals which made the Congress leadership uncomfortable. Singh then unearthed the Bofors scandal, and was sacked from the party and office. Becoming a popular crusader for reform and clean government, Singh led the Janata Dal coalition to a majority. He was supported by BJP and the leftist parties from outside. Becoming Prime Minister, Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple shrine, to heal the wounds of the past. He implemented the Mandal Commission report, to increase the quota in reservation for low-caste Hindus. His government fell after Singh, along with Bihar's Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav's government, had Advani arrested in Samastipur and stopped his Ram Rath Yatra, which was going to the Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya on 23 October 1990. The Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew their support to Singh government, causing them to lose parliamentary vote of confidence on 7 November 1990. Chandra Shekhar split to form the Janata Dal (Socialist), supported by Rajiv's Congress. This new government also collapsed in a matter of months, when Congress withdrew its support.\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\nThe then-Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah (son of former Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah) announced an alliance with the ruling Congress party for the elections of 1987. But, the elections were allegedly rigged in favour of him. This led to the rise of the armed extremist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost elections. India has constantly maintained the position of blaming Pakistan for supplying these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training.\nMilitants in Kashmir reportedly tortured and killed local Kashmiri Pandits, forcing them to leave Kashmir in large numbers. Around 90% of the Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir during the 1990s, resulting in the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus.\nOn 21 May 1991, while former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi campaigned in Tamil Nadu on behalf of Congress (Indira), a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) female suicide bomber assassinated him and many others by setting off the bomb in her belt by leaning forward while garlanding him. In the elections, Congress (Indira) won 244 parliamentary seats and put together a coalition, returning to power under the leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao. This Congress-led government, which served a full five-year term, initiated a gradual process of economic liberalisation and reform, which has opened the Indian economy to global trade and investment. India's domestic politics also took new shape, as traditional alignments by caste, creed, and ethnicity gave way to a plethora of small, regionally-based political parties.\n\nBut India was rocked by communal violence (see Bombay riots) between Hindus and Muslims that killed over 10,000 people, following the Babri Mosque demolition by Hindu extremists in the course of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya in December 1992. The final months of the Rao-led government in the spring of 1996 suffered the effects of several major political corruption scandals, which contributed to the worst electoral performance by the Congress Party in its history till then as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the largest single party.\n\n\n=== Economic reforms ===\n\nUnder the policies initiated by the then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, India's economy expanded rapidly. The economic reforms were a reaction to an impending balance of payment crisis. The Rao administration initiated the privatisation of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the 1997 Asian financial crisis and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound fiscal policy aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Ahmedabad have risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment and firms. Strategies like forming Special Economic Zones‚Äîtax amenities, good communications infrastructure, low regulation‚Äîto encourage industries has paid off in many parts of the country.\n\nA rising generation of well-educated and skilled professionals in scientific sectors of the industry began propelling the Indian economy, as the information technology industry took hold across India with the proliferation of computers. The new technologies increased the efficiency of activity in almost every type of industry, which also benefitted from the availability of skilled labor. Foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs to India's labor markets further enhanced India's economic growth. A large middle class has arisen across India, which has increased the demand, and thus the production of a wide array of consumer goods. Unemployment is steadily declining, and poverty has fallen to approximately 22%. Gross Domestic Product growth increased to beyond 7%. While serious challenges remain, India is enjoying a period of economic expansion that has propelled it to the forefront of the world economy, and has correspondingly increased its influence in political and diplomatic terms.\n\n\n=== Era of coalitions ===\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha but without enough strength to prove a majority on the floor of that Parliament. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the Janata Dal emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former Chief Minister of Karnataka H. D. Deve Gowda lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew support in March 1997. Inder Kumar Gujral replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition.\nIn November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with Vajpayee again serving as prime minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of five underground nuclear weapons tests, known collectively as Pokhran-II ‚Äî which caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. India's nuclear tests prompted President of the United States Bill Clinton and Japan to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act and led to widespread international condemnation.\nIn the early months of 1999, Prime Minister Vajpayee made a historic bus trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistan's prime minister Nawaz Sharif, signing the bilateral Lahore peace declaration.\nIn April 1999, the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell apart, leading to fresh elections in September. In May and June 1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign of terrorist infiltration that resulted in the Kargil War in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace process that had begun only three months earlier when Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore bus service. Indian forces killed Pakistan-backed infiltrators and reclaimed important border posts in high-altitude warfare.\n\nSoaring on popularity earned following the successful conclusion of the Kargil conflict, the National Democratic Alliance‚Äîa new coalition led by the BJP‚Äîgained a majority to form a government with Vajpayee as prime minister in October 1999. The end of the millennium was devastating to India, as a cyclone hit Orissa, killing at least 10,000.\n\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n\n=== Under Bharatiya Janata Party ===\nIn May 2000, India's population exceeded 1 billion. President of the United States Bill Clinton made a groundbreaking visit to India to improve ties between the two nations. In January, massive earthquakes hit Gujarat state, killing at least 30,000.\nPrime Minister Vajpayee met with Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf in the first summit between Pakistan and India in more than two years in the middle of 2001. But the meeting failed without a breakthrough or even a joint statement because of differences over Kashmir region.\nThree new states ‚Äî Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand (originally Uttaranchal) ‚Äî were formed in November 2000.\nThe National Democratic Alliance government's credibility was adversely affected by a number of political scandals (such as allegations that the Defence Minister George Fernandes took bribes) as well as reports of intelligence failures that led to the Kargil incursions going undetected, and the apparent failure of his talks with the Pakistani President. Following the September 11 attacks, the United States lifted sanctions which it had imposed against India and Pakistan in 1998. The move was seen as a reward for their support for the War on Terror. The tensions of an imminent war between India and Pakistan again rose by the heavy Indian firing on Pakistani military posts along the Line of Control and the subsequent deadly Indian Parliament attack and the 2001‚Äì02 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff.\nIn 2002, 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed in a train fire in Godhra, Gujarat. This sparked off the 2002 Gujarat riots, leading to the deaths of 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus and with 223 people reported missing.\n\nThroughout 2003, India's speedy economic progress, political stability, and a rejuvenated peace initiative with Pakistan increased the government's popularity. India and Pakistan agreed to resume direct air links and to allow overflights, and a groundbreaking meeting was held between the Indian government and moderate Kashmir separatists. The Golden Quadrilateral project aimed to link India's corners with a network of modern highways.\n\n\n=== Congress rule returns ===\nIn January 2004 Prime Minister Vajpayee recommended early dissolution of the Lok Sabha and general elections. an alliance led by the Congress Party called United Progressive Alliance(UPA) won a surprise victory in elections held in May 2004. Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister, after the Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, declined to take the office, to defuse the controversy about whether her foreign birth should be considered a disqualification for the Prime Minister's post. Apart from the Congress party, other members of UPA included Socialist and regional parties. The alliance had outside support of India's Communist parties. Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh and non-Hindu to hold India's most powerful office. Singh continued economic liberalisation, although the need for support from Indian Socialists and Communists forestalled further privatisation for some time.\nBy the end of 2004, India began to withdraw some of its troops from Kashmir. By the middle of the next year, the Srinagar‚ÄìMuzaffarabad Bus service was inaugurated, the first in 60 years to operate between Indian-administered and Pakistani-administered Kashmirs. However, in May 2006, suspected Islamic extremist militants killed 35 Hindus in the worst attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir for several months.\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami devastated Indian coastlines and islands, killing an estimated 18,000 and displacing around 650,000. The tsunami was caused by a powerful undersea earthquake off the Indonesian coast. Natural disasters such as the Mumbai floods (killing more than 1,000) and Kashmir earthquake (killing 79,000) hit the subcontinent in the next year. In February 2006, the United Progressive Alliance government launched India's largest-ever rural jobs scheme, aimed at lifting around 60 million families out of poverty.\n\nThe United States and India signed a major nuclear co-operation agreement during a visit by United States President George W. Bush in March 2006. According to the nuclear deal, the United States was to give India access to civilian nuclear technology while India agreed to greater scrutiny for its nuclear programme. Later, United States approved a controversial law allowing India to buy their nuclear reactors and fuel for the first time in 30 years. In July 2008, the United Progressive Alliance survived a vote of confidence brought after left-wing parties withdrew their support over the nuclear deal. After the vote, several left-wing and regional parties formed a new alliance to oppose the government, saying it had been tainted by corruption. Within three months, following approval by the U.S. Congress, George W. Bush signed into law a nuclear deal with India, which ended a three-decade ban on American nuclear trade with Delhi.\nIn 2007, India got its first female President as Pratibha Patil was sworn in. Long associated with the Nehru‚ÄìGandhi family, Pratibha Patil was a low-profile governor of the state of Rajasthan before emerging as the favoured presidential candidate of Sonia Gandhi. In February, the infamous Samjhauta Express bombings took place, killing Pakistani civilians in Panipat, Haryana. As of 2011, nobody had been charged for the crime, though it has been linked to Abhinav Bharat, a shadowy Hindu fundamentalist group headed by a former Indian army officer.\nIn 2008 October, India successfully launched its first mission to the Moon, the uncrewed lunar probe called Chandrayaan-1. In the previous year, India had launched its first commercial space rocket, carrying an Italian satellite.\n\nIn November 2008, Mumbai attacks took place. India blamed militants from Pakistan for the attacks and announced a \"pause\" in the ongoing peace process.\nIn July 2009, the Delhi High Court decriminalised consensual homosexual sex, re-interpreting the British Raj-era law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, as unconstitutional in regard to criminalising consensual sex between two homosexual adults or decriminalising such acts between adult heterosexuals or other consenting adults, that may be deemed unnatural.\nIn the Indian general election in 2009, the United Progressive Alliance won a convincing and resounding 262 seats, with Congress alone winning 206 seats. However, the Congress-led government faced many allegations of corruption. Inflation rose to an all-time high, and the ever-increasing prices of food commodities caused widespread agitation.\n\nOn 8 November 2009, in spite of strong protests by China, which claims the whole of Arunachal Pradesh as its own, the 14th Dalai Lama visited Tawang Monastery in Arunachal Pradesh,\nwhich was a monumental event to the people of the region, and the abbot of the monastery greeted him with much fanfare and adulation.\n21st-century India is facing the Naxalite‚ÄìMaoist rebels, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India's \"greatest internal security challenge\", and other terrorist tensions (such as Islamist terrorist campaigns in and out of Jammu & Kashmir and terrorism in India's Northeast). Terrorism has increased in India, with bomb blasts in leading cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. In the new millennium, India improved relations with many countries and foreign unions including the United States, the European Union, Israel, and the People's Republic of China. The economy of India has grown at a very rapid pace. India was now being looked at as a potential superpower.\n\n\n== 2010s ==\n\n\n=== Congress rule continues ===\n\nThe concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games rocked the country in 2010, raising questions about the credibility of the government followed by the 2G spectrum case and Adarsh Housing Society scam. In mid-2011, Anna Hazare, a prominent social activist, staged a 12-day hunger strike in Delhi in protest at state corruption, after government proposals to tighten up anti-graft legislation fell short of his demands.\nDespite all this, India showed great promise with a higher growth rate in gross domestic product. In January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the United Nations Security Council for the 2011‚Äì12 term. In 2004, India had launched an application for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, along with Brazil, Germany and Japan. In March, India overtook China to become the world's largest importer of arms.\nThe Telangana movement reached its peak in 2011‚Äì12, leading to formation of India's 29th state, Telangana, in June 2014.\n\nIn August 2010, cloudbursts and the ensuing flooding in the Ladakh region of North India resulted in the deaths of around 255 people, while affecting 9,000 people directly. In June 2013, a multi-day cloudburst in Uttarakhand and other north Indian states caused devastating floods and landslides, with more than 5,700 people \"presumed dead.\" In September 2014, floods in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, following heavy rains due to monsoon season, killed around 277 people and brought extensive damage to property. A further 280 people died in the neighbouring Pakistani regions, particularly in Pakistani Punjab.\nThe 2012 Delhi gang rape & murder case and subsequent protests resulted in changes in the laws related to rape and offences against women. In April 2013, the Saradha Group scandal was unearthed, caused by the collapse of a Ponzi scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies in Eastern India, causing an estimated loss of INR 200‚Äì300 billion (US$4‚Äì6 billion) to over 1.7 million depositors. In December 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the Delhi High Court ruling on Sec 377, criminalising homosexual sex between consenting adults once again in the country.\nIn August ‚Äì September 2013, clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, resulted in at least 62 deaths, injured 93, and left more than 50,000 displaced.\n\nIn November 2013, India launched its first interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission, popularly known as Mangalyaan, to Mars and, was successful, so ISRO on 24 September 2014, became the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency. ISRO also became the first space agency and India the first country to reach Mars on its maiden attempt.\n\n\n=== 2014 ‚Äì Return of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government ===\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right since the 1950s had been the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. The Jana Sangh joined the Janata party in 1977 but when that party fell apart in a short period of three years, the erstwhile members of Jana Sangh in 1980 formed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP grew its support base in the following decades and is now the most dominant political party in India. In September 2013 the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders initially expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani. Contrary to the strategies used by the party during previous elections, Modi played the dominant role in the BJP's presidential style election campaign. The 16th national general election, held in early 2014, saw a huge victory for the BJP led NDA; the alliance gained an absolute majority and formed a government under the premiership of Modi. The Modi government's sweeping mandate and popularity helped the BJP win several state assembly elections in India. The Modi government implemented several initiatives and campaigns to increase manufacturing and infrastructure ‚Äì notably ‚Äî Make in India, Digital India and the Swachh Bharat Mission.\nThe largest tax reform in India's history, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), was introduced in 2017. A vehicle-borne suicide bomber assaulted a convoy of cars carrying Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troops on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway in the Pulwama area of Jammu and Kashmir.\nIndia carried out the 2019 Balakot airstrike when its airplanes flew across the de facto border in Kashmir and dropped bombs in the town of Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. After a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani fighter pilots. Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian wing commander, was taken prisoner by the Pakistani side. Acting nonetheless under pressure from various world leaders and constrained by the Vienna Convention, Pakistan was compelled to free the Indian pilot.\nBy repealing Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was separated into two separate union territories known as Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The BJP government introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act in 2019, sparking widespread protests.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== 2020s ==\nIn February 2020, riots broke out in Delhi. The Citizenship Amendment Act protests have been described as an instigating factor. Tensions escalated on the Indo-China border after aggressive skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops beginning on 5 May 2020. The Rama Janmabhoomi temple construction officially started after a Bhoomi Poojan (Hindu ground breaking) ceremony by Prime Minister Modi on 5 August 2020. Farm reform laws which subsequently became quite controversial were passed with less than three hours of debate in either house in September 2020.\n\nAfter a year long protests by farmers, Prime minister Modi in November 2021 repealed the laws in three minutes in the Lok Sabha and nine minutes in the Rajya Sabha without debate.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in India began on 30 January 2020, when the first case was reported in Thrissur. Two months later in March 2020, prime minister Modi imposed a complete lockdown in the country at four hours notice to stop the spread of COVID-19. This led to millions losing their jobs and many lost their lives. The Indian economy also shrunk in percentage terms by double digit numbers. In September 2020, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the country planned to approve and begin distribution of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021. Vaccination against COVID-19 started in India on 16 January 2021. By early April 2021, second wave of infections took hold in the country with destructive consequences. According to Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York, technocratic competence had been entirely missing from government's  response to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The second wave placed a major strain on the healthcare system, including shortage of liquid medical oxygen. The number of new cases had begun to steadily drop by late-May and vaccination gained momentum again. India administered 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine on 21 October 2021. Although official number of Covid related deaths in India during the pandemic is less than half a million, excess mortality rates for all causes has been  estimated at between 3 and 5 million deaths.\n\n\n=== Post COVID India ===\nOn 25 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was sworn in as India's new president, becoming India's first tribal president. Although largely ceremonial post, Murmu's election as tribal woman was historic. India celebrated 75 years of its independence from the British Empire on 15 August 2022. In April 2023, India surpassed China to become the most populous country on the earth with a population of over 1.425 billion. India was selected as the host for the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit at the International Exhibition Convention Centre, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi from 9 to 10 September 2023.  Chandrayaan-3, a lunar lander developed and launched by ISRO landed on the Moon on 23 August 2023, thus making India the 4th country to land on the Moon after the Soviet Union, China, and United States.\nGeneral elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases to elect the members of 18th Lok Sabha. The BJP won 240 seats, down from 303 seats it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha. Modi confirmed the support of 293 NDA MPs to President Draupadi Murmu, which marked Modi's third term as prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government, with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economic history of the India since 1947 can be divided into two epochs:\n1.1947-91 which saw heavy government involvement in the economy, and a slow growth rate in GDP\n2.1991‚Äìpresent which saw deregulation and a rapid growth in GDP, and reduction in poverty.\n\n\n=== Pre-liberalisation period (1947‚Äì1991) ===\n\nIndian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience, which was seen as exploitative by Indian leaders exposed to British social democracy and the planned economy of the Soviet Union. Domestic policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public sector, business regulation, and central planning, while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal. Five-Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools, telecommunications, insurance, and power plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s. The Indian economy of this period is characterised as Dirigism.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, along with the statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, formulated and oversaw economic policy during the initial years of the country's independence. They expected favourable outcomes from their strategy, involving the rapid development of heavy industry by both public and private sectors, and based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme Soviet-style central command system. The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive heavy industry and subsidising manual, low-skill cottage industries was criticised by economist Milton Friedman, who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers.\nSince 1965, the use of high-yielding varieties of seeds, increased fertilisers and improved irrigation facilities collectively contributed to the Green Revolution in India, which improved the condition of agriculture by increasing crop productivity, improving crop patterns and strengthening forward and backward linkages between agriculture and industry. However, it has also been criticised as an unsustainable effort, resulting in the growth of capitalistic farming, ignoring institutional reforms and widening income disparities.\nIn 1984, Rajiv Gandhi promised economic liberalization, he made V. P. Singh the finance minister, who tried to reduce tax evasion and tax receipts rose due to this crackdown although taxes were lowered. This process lost its momentum during the later tenure of Mr. Gandhi as his government was marred by scandals.\n\n\n=== Post-liberalisation period (since 1991) ===\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union, which was India's major trading partner, and the Gulf War, which caused a spike in oil prices, resulted in a major balance-of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of defaulting on its loans. India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which in return demanded de-regulation.\nIn response, the Narasimha Rao government, including Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, initiated economic reforms in 1991. The reforms did away with the Licence Raj, reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors. Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained unchanged since 1991, although no government had tried taking on powerful lobbies such as trade unions and farmers and on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. By the turn of the 21st century, India had progressed towards a free-market economy, with a substantial reduction in state control of the economy and increased financial liberalisation. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates, and food security, although urban residents have benefited more than rural residents.\n\nIn the second decade of this century, the economy of India rose from the ninth-largest to the fifth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, surpassing the UK, France, Italy and Brazil. The economy had started to slow down in the second term of Manmohan Singh's tenure but started a recovery in 2013‚Äì14 when the GDP growth rate accelerated to 6.4% from the previous year's 5.5%. The acceleration continued through 2014‚Äì15 and 2015‚Äì16 with growth rates of 7.5% and 8.0% respectively in the early early years under Narendra Modi's first term. However the growth rate subsequently decelerated, to 7.1% and 6.6% in 2016‚Äì17 and 2017‚Äì18 respectively, partly because of the disruptive effects of 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (India).\n\n\n==== COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath (2020‚Äìpresent) ====\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous rating agencies downgraded India's GDP predictions for FY21 to negative figures, signalling a recession in India, the most severe since 1979. The Indian Economy contracted by 6.6 percent which was lower than the estimated 7.3 percent decline. In 2022, the ratings agency Fitch Ratings upgraded India's outlook to stable similar to S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service's outlooks. In the first quarter of financial year 2022‚Äì2023, the Indian economy grew by 13.5%.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDemocracy in India\nPolitics of India\nEconomic history of India\nEconomy of India\nMilitary history of India\nOutline of ancient India\nThe Emergency (India)\nLicence Raj\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBipan Chandra, Mridula Mukherjee and Aditya Mukherjee. \"India Since Independence\"\nBates, Crispin, and Subho Basu.

      "summary": "The history of independent India or history of Republic of India began when the country became an independent sovereign state within the British Commonwealth on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, affected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries‚ÄîIndia, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims. Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the Partition of India. The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The constitution adopted in 1950 made India a democratic republic with Westminster style parliamentary system of government, both at federal and state level respectively. The  democracy has been sustained since then. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newly independent states.\nThe country has faced religious violence, naxalism, terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China which escalated into a war in 1962 and 1967, and with Pakistan which resulted in wars in 1947‚Äì1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999. India was neutral in the Cold War, and was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. However, it made a loose alliance with the Soviet Union from 1971, when Pakistan was allied with the United States and the People's Republic of China.\n\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, having conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, followed by another five tests in 1998. From the 1950s to the 1980s, India followed socialist-inspired policies. The economy was influenced by extensive regulation, protectionism and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow economic growth. Since 1991, India has pursued more economic liberalisation. Today, India is the third largest and one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nFrom being a relatively struggling country in its formative years, the Republic of India has emerged as a fast growing G20 major economy. India has sometimes been referred to as a great power and a potential superpower given its large and growing economy, military and population.\n\n",

      "title": "History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia",
      "content": "Southeast Asia was in the Indian sphere of cultural influence from 290 BCE to the 15th century CE, when Hindu-Buddhist influences were incorporated into local political systems. Kingdoms in the southeast coast of the Indian subcontinent had established trade, cultural and political relations with Southeast Asian kingdoms in Burma, Bhutan, Thailand, the Sunda Islands, Malay Peninsula, Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, and Champa. This led to the Indianisation and Sanskritisation of Southeast Asia within the Indosphere, Southeast Asian polities were the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist Mandala (polities, city states and confederacies).\nIndian culture itself arose from various distinct cultures and peoples, also including Austroasiatic lingusitic influence onto early Indians. However some scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and L√©vi, concluded that not only linguistic but there are also some cultural, and even political Austroasiatic influence on early Indian culture and traditions. India is seen a melting pot of western, eastern and indigenous traditions. This distinctly Indian cultural system was later adopted and assimilated into the indigenous social construct and statehood of Southeast Asian regional polity, which rulers gained power and stability, transforming small chieftains into regional powers.\nUnlike the other kingdoms which existed on the Indian subcontinent, the Pallava empire which ruled the southeastern coast of the Indian peninsula did not impose cultural restrictions on people who wished to cross the sea. The Chola empire, which executed the South-East Asian campaign of Rajendra Chola I and the Chola invasion of Srivijaya, profoundly impacted Southeast Asia. This impact led to more exchanges with Southeast Asia on the sea routes. Whereas Buddhism thrived and became the main religion in many countries of Southeast Asia, it became a minority religion in India.\nThe peoples of maritime Southeast Asia ‚Äî present-day Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines ‚Äî are thought to have migrated southward from South China sometime between 2500 and 1500 BC. The influence of the civilization which existed on the Indian Subcontinent gradually became predominant among them, and it also became predominant among the peoples which lived on the Southeast Asian mainland.\nSouthern Indian traders, adventurers, teachers and priests continued to be the dominating influences in Southeast Asia until about 1500 CE. Hinduism and Buddhism both spread to these states from India and for many centuries, they existed there with mutual toleration. Eventually the states of the mainland mainly became Buddhist.\n\n\n== Drivers of the Indianization of Southeast Asia ==\nThe key drivers of the Indianisation of Southeast Asia were the Austronesian and Indian maritime trade especially the Spice trade and the Maritime Silk Road, the emissaries of Ashoka, and the Buddhist missions of Emperor Ashoka the Great.\n\n\n== Indian maritime trade with Southeast Asia ==\n\nAustronesian sailors from Island Southeast Asia first established contact and trade with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 500 BCE. This resulted in the introduction of Southeast Asian material culture and cultigens to South Asia; as well as connecting the material cultures of India and China. These early Austronesian trade routes linking Island Southeast Asia with India also became the maritime aspect of the wider spice trade network, which were later also used by Tamil and Arab maritime trade. The sustained contact between Southeast Asia and South Asia resulted in cultural exchange, in addition to the exchange of commodities.\nThe first clear mention of a navy occurs in the mythological epic the Mahabharata. Historically, however, the first attested attempt to organise a navy in India, as described by Megasthenes (c. 350‚Äî290 BCE), is attributed to Chandragupta Maurya (reign 322‚Äî298 BCE). The Mauryan empire (322‚Äì185 BCE) navy continued till the times of emperor Ashoka (reign 273‚Äî232 BCE), who used it to send massive diplomatic missions to Greece, Syria, Egypt, Cyrene, Macedonia and Epirus. Following nomadic interference in Siberia‚Äîone of the sources for India's bullion‚ÄîIndia diverted its attention to the Malay Peninsula, which became its new source for gold and was soon exposed to the world via a series of maritime trade routes. The period under the Mauryan empire also witnessed various other regions of the world engage increasingly in the Indian Ocean maritime voyages.\n\n\n=== Buddhist missions ===\nIn the Sri Lankan tradition, Moggaliputta-Tissa ‚Äì who is patronised by Ashoka ‚Äì sends out nine Buddhist missions to spread Buddhism in the \"border areas\" in c. 250 BCE. This tradition does not credit Ashoka directly with sending these missions. Each mission comprises five monks, and is headed by an elder. To Sri Lanka, he sent his own son Mahinda, accompanied by four other Theras ‚Äì Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala. Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.\nThe Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:\n\nMahinda to Sri Lanka\nMajjhantika to Kashmir and Gandhara\nMahadeva to Mahisa-mandala (possibly modern Mysore region)\nRakkhita to Vanavasa\nDhammarakkhita the Greek to Aparantaka (western India)\nMaha-dhamma-rakkhita to Maharashtra\nMaharakkhita to the Greek country\nMajjhima to the Himalayas\nSo·πáa and Uttara to Suva·πá·πáabh≈´mi (possibly Lower Burma and Thailand)\nThe tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.\nScholars, such as Erich Frauwallner and Richard Gombrich, believe that the missions mentioned in the Sri Lankan tradition are historical. According to these scholars, a part of this story is corroborated by archaeological evidence: the Vinaya Nidana mentions names of five monks, who are said to have gone to the Himalayan region; three of these names have been found inscribed on relic caskets found at Bhilsa (near Vidisha). These caskets have been dated to early 2nd century BCE, and the inscription states that the monks are of the Himalayan school. The missions may have set out from Vidisha in central India, as the caskets were discovered there, and as Mahinda is said to have stayed there for a month before setting out for Sri Lanka.\nAccording to Gombrich, the mission may have included representatives of other religions, and thus, Lamotte's objection about \"dhamma\" is not valid. The Buddhist chroniclers may have decided not to mention these non-Buddhists, so as not to sideline Buddhism. Frauwallner and Gombrich also believe that Ashoka was directly responsible for the missions, since only a resourceful ruler could have sponsored such activities. The Sri Lankan chronicles, which belong to the Theravada school, exaggerate the role of the Theravadin monk Moggaliputta-Tissa in order to glorify their sect.\nSome historians argue that Buddhism became a major religion because of Ashoka's royal patronage.\n\n\n=== Early Common Era‚ÄîHigh Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring this era, Hindu and Buddhist religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with economic activity and commerce as patrons entrusted large funds which would later be used to benefit local economy by estate management, craftsmanship and promotion of trading activities. Buddhism, in particular, travelled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art and literacy.\nIn Java and Borneo, the introduction of Indian culture created a demand for aromatics, and trading posts here later served Chinese and Arab markets. The Periplus Maris Erythraei names several Indian ports from where large ships sailed in an easterly direction to Chryse. Products from the Maluku Islands that were shipped across the ports of Arabia to the Near East passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka. After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, products were sometimes shipped to East Africa, where they were used for a variety of purposes including burial rites.\nMaritime history of Odisha, known as Kalinga in ancient times, started before 350 BC according to early sources. The people of this region of eastern India along the coast of the Bay of Bengal sailed up and down the Indian coast, and travelled to Indo China and throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, introducing elements of their culture to the people with whom they traded. The 6th century Manjusrimulakalpa mentions the Bay of Bengal as 'Kalingodra' and historically the Bay of Bengal has been called 'Kalinga Sagara' (both Kalingodra and Kalinga Sagara mean Kalinga Sea), indicating the importance of Kalinga in the maritime trade. The old traditions are still celebrated in the annual Bali Jatra, or Boita-Bandana festival held for five days in October / November.\nThe Chola dynasty (200‚Äî1279) reached the peak of its influence and power during the medieval period. Emperors Rajaraja Chola I (reigned 985‚Äì1014) and Rajendra Chola I (reigned 1012‚Äì1044) extended the Chola kingdom beyond the traditional limits. At its peak, the Chola Empire stretched from the island of Sri Lanka in the south to the Godavari basin in the north. The kingdoms along the east coast of India up to the river Ganges acknowledged Chola suzerainty. Chola navies invaded and conquered Srivijaya and Srivijaya was the largest empire in Maritime Southeast Asia. Goods and ideas from India began to play a major role in the \"Indianization\" of the wider world from this period.\nQuilon or Kollam in Kerala coast, once called Desinganadu, has had a high commercial reputation since the days of the Phoenicians and Romans. Fed by the Chinese trade, it was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen in the course of his travels during twenty-four years. The Kollam Port became operational by AD.825, allowing Desinganadu's rulers to exchange the embassies with Chinese rulers and there was flourishing Chinese settlement at Quilon. The Indian commercial connection with Southeast Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and Persia between the 7th and 8th centuries CE.\nThe kingdoms of Vijaynagara and Kalinga established footholds in Malaya, Sumatra and Western Java.\nThe Cholas excelled in foreign trade and maritime activity, extending their influence overseas to China and Southeast Asia. Towards the end of the 9th century, southern India had developed extensive maritime and commercial activity. The Cholas, being in possession of parts of both the west and the east coasts of peninsular India, were at the forefront of these ventures. The Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) of China, the Srivijaya empire in Maritime Southeast Asia under the Sailendras, and the Abbasid caliphate at Baghdad were the main trading partners.\nDuring the reign of Pandya Parantaka Nedumjadaiyan (765‚Äì790), the Chera dynasty were a close ally of the Pallavas. Pallavamalla Nadivarman defeated the Pandya Varaguna with the help of a Chera king. Cultural contacts between the Pallava court and the Chera country were common. Indian spice exports find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850), al-Ghafiqi (1150 CE), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century). Chinese traveler Xuanzang mentions the town of Puri where \"merchants depart for distant countries.\"\n\n\n== Late Middle Ages ==\n\nMa Huan (1413‚Äì51) reached Cochin and noted that Indian coins, known as fanam, were issued in Cochin and weighed a total of one fen and one li according to the Chinese standards. They were of fine quality and could be exchanged in China for 15 silver coins of four-li weight each.\n\n\n=== Maritime route ===\n\nMaritime Silk Road or Maritime Silk Route refer to the maritime section of historic Silk Road that connects China to Southeast Asia, Indonesian archipelago, Indian subcontinent, Arabian Peninsula, all the way to Egypt and finally Europe.\nThe trade route encompassed numbers of bodies of waters; including South China Sea, Strait of Malacca, Indian Ocean, Gulf of Bengal, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. The maritime route overlaps with historic Southeast Asian maritime trade, Spice trade, Indian Ocean trade and after 8th century ‚Äì the Arabian naval trade network. The network also extend eastward to East China Sea and Yellow Sea to connect China with Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelago.\n\n\n=== Expansion of religions ===\n\nRichard Foltz, Xinru Liu, and others have described how trading activities along the Silk Road over many centuries facilitated the transmission not just of goods but also ideas and culture, notably in the area of religions. Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam all spread across Eurasia through trade networks that were tied to specific religious communities and their institutions. Notably, established Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road offered a haven, as well as a new religion for foreigners.\nThe spread of religions and cultural traditions along the Silk Roads, according to Jerry H. Bentley, also led to syncretism. One example was the encounter with the Chinese and Xiongnu nomads. These unlikely events of cross-cultural contact allowed both cultures to adapt to each other as an alternative. The Xiongnu adopted Chinese agricultural techniques, dress style, and lifestyle, while the Chinese adopted Xiongnu military techniques, some dress style, music, and dance. Perhaps most surprising of the cultural exchanges between China and the Xiongnu, Chinese soldiers sometimes defected and converted to the Xiongnu way of life, and stayed in the steppes for fear of punishment.\nNomadic mobility played a key role in facilitating inter-regional contacts and cultural exchanges along the ancient Silk Roads.\n\n\n==== Transmission of Buddhism ====\n\nBuddhist knowledge among people on the Silk Road increased when Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty (268‚Äì239 BCE) converted to Buddhism and raised the religion to official status in his northern Indian empire. The transmission of Buddhism to China via the Silk Road became prominent in the 1st century CE, according to a semi-legendary account of an ambassador sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor Ming (58‚Äì75). During this period Buddhism began to spread throughout Southeast, East, and Central Asia. Mahayana, Theravada, and Tibetan Buddhism are the three primary forms of Buddhism that spread across Asia via the Silk Road.\nThe Buddhist movement was the first large-scale missionary movement in the history of world religions. Chinese missionaries were able to assimilate Buddhism, to an extent, to native Chinese Daoists, which brought the two beliefs together. Buddha's community of followers, the Sangha, consisted of male and female monks and laity. These people moved through India and beyond to spread the ideas of Buddha. As the number of members within the Sangha increased, it became costly so that only the larger cities were able to afford having the Buddha and his disciples visit. It is believed that under the control of the Kushans, Buddhism was spread to China and other parts of Asia from the middle of the first century to the middle of the third century. Extensive contacts started in the 2nd century, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the Kushan empire into the territory of the Tarim Basin, due to the missionary efforts of a great number of Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were either Parthian, Kushan, Sogdian, or Kuchean.\n\nOne result of the spread of Buddhism along the Silk Road was displacement and conflict. The Greek Seleucids were exiled to Iran and Central Asia because of a new Iranian dynasty called the Parthians at the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, and as a result the Parthians became the new middle men for trade in a period when the Romans were major customers for silk. Parthian scholars were involved in one of the first Buddhist text translations into the Chinese language. Its main trade centre on the Silk Road, the city of Merv, in due course and with the coming of age of Buddhism in China, became a major Buddhist centre by the middle of the 2nd century. \nFrom the 4th century CE onward, Chinese pilgrims also started to travel on the Silk Road to India to get improved access to the original Buddhist scriptures, with Fa-hsien's pilgrimage to India (395‚Äì414), and later Xuanzang (629‚Äì644) and Hyecho, who traveled from Korea to India. The travels of the priest Xuanzang were fictionalized in the 16th century in a fantasy adventure novel called Journey to the West, which told of trials with demons and the aid given by various disciples on the journey.\n\nThere were many different schools of Buddhism travelling on the Silk Road. The Dharmaguptakas and the Sarvastivadins were two of the major Nikaya schools. These were both eventually displaced by the Mahayana, also known as \"Great Vehicle\". This movement of Buddhism first gained influence in the Khotan region. The Mahayana, which was more of a \"pan-Buddhist movement\" than a school of Buddhism, appears to have begun in northwestern India or Central Asia. It formed during the 1st century BCE and was small at first, and the origins of this \"Greater Vehicle\" are not fully clear. Some Mahayana scripts were found in northern Pakistan, but the main texts are still believed to have been composed in Central Asia along the Silk Road. These different schools and movements of Buddhism were a result of the diverse and complex influences and beliefs on the Silk Road. With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, the initial direction of Buddhist development changed. This form of Buddhism highlighted, as stated by Xinru Liu, \"the elusiveness of physical reality, including material wealth.\" It also stressed getting rid of material desire to a certain point; this was often difficult for followers to understand.\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries CE, merchants played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism an appealing alternative to previous religions. Merchants supported Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road, and in return the Buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled. Merchants also helped to establish diaspora within the communities they encountered, and over time their cultures became based on Buddhism. These communities became centers of literacy and culture with well-organized marketplaces, lodging, and storage. The voluntary conversion of Chinese ruling elites helped the spread of Buddhism in East Asia and led Buddhism to become widespread in Chinese society. The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism essentially ended in Central Asia around the 7th century with the rise of Islam.\n\n\n== Brunei ==\n\n\n=== Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (? - ~1400) ===\nThe history of Brunei before the arrival of Magellan's ships in 1519-1522 CE is based on the interpretation of Chinese sources and local legends. Historians believe that there was a forerunner Indianised Hindu-Buddhist state to the present day Brunei Sultanate. One predecessor state was called Vijayapura, which possibly existed in northwest Borneo in the 7th century. It was probably a subject state of the powerful Indianised Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire based in Sumatra. One predecessor state was called Po-ni (pinyin: Boni). By the 10th century Po-ni had contacts with first the Song dynasty and at some point even entered into a tributary relationship with China. By the 14th century Po-ni also fell under the influence of the Indianised Hindu Javanese Majapahit Empire. The book of Nagarakretagama, canto 14, written by Prapanca in 1365 mentioned Berune as a vassal state of Majahpahit. However this may have been nothing more than a symbolic relationship, as one account of the annual tribute owed each year to Majahpahit was a jar of areca juice obtained from the young green nuts of the areca palm. The Ming dynasty resumed communications with Po-ni in the 1370s and the Po-ni ruler Ma-na-jih-chia-na visited the Ming capital Nanjing in 1408 and died there; his tomb was rediscovered in the 20th century, and is now a protected monument.\n\n\n=== Indianised Islamic sultanate (~1400 - present day) ===\nIn 1402, Sultan Muhammad Shah died, he was first to convert from Hindu-Buddhism to Islam, and his pre-conversion name was Awang Alak Betatar.\n\n\n== Burma (Myanmar) ==\nAt the western end of the South East Asian mainland, Lower Burma was occupied by the Mon peoples who are thought to have come originally from western China. In Lower Burma they supplanted an earlier people: the Pyu, of whom little is known except that they practised Hinduism.\n\n\n=== Arrival of Buddhism and impact of Indian literature (3rd century CE onward) ===\nThe Mons strongly influenced by their contacts with Indian traders during the 3rd century B.C adopted Indian literature and art and the Buddhist religion. The Mons were one of the earliest known civilizations in Southeast Asia. They consisted of several Mon kingdoms, spreading from Lower Burma into much of Thailand, where they founded the kingdom of Dvaravati. Their principal settlements in Burma were Thaton Kingdom and Pegu.\n\n\n=== Tibeto-Burman Buddhist kingdoms (11th - 13th century CE ) ===\nFrom about the 9th century onward Tibeto-Burman tribes moved south from the hills east of Tibet into the Irrawaddy plain. They founded their capital at Bagan in Upper Burma in the 10th century. They eventually absorbed the Mons, their cities and adopted the Mon civilization and Buddhism. The Bagan Kingdom united all Burma under one rule for 200 years - from the 11th to 13th centuries. The zenith of its power occurred during the reign of King Anawratha (1044‚Äì1077), who conquered the Mon kingdom of Thaton. King Anawratha built many of the temples for which Bagan is famous. It is estimated that some 13,000 temples once existed within the city, which some 5,000 still stand.\n\n\n=== 13th-21st century ===\n\nIn the 14th century, the Delhi sultanate controlled nearly all the territory that comprises present-day India. However, invaders from Central Asia weakened and broke up the sultanate's empire before it was swept aside by the Mughals in 1526.\n\n\n== Cambodia ==\n\n\n=== Funan ===\n\nThe first of these Hinduised states to achieve widespread importance was the Kingdom of Funan founded in the 1st century CE in what is now Cambodia ‚Äî according to legend, after the marriage of a merchant Buddhist monk Kaundinya I with princess Soma who was the daughter of the chieftain of the local NƒÅga clan. Funan flourished for some 500 years. It carried on a prosperous trade with India and China, and its engineers developed an extensive canal system. An elite practised statecraft, art and science, based on Indian culture. Vassal kingdoms spread to southern Vietnam in the east and to the Malay Peninsula in the west.\n\n\n=== Chenla and Angkor ===\n\nIn late 6th century CE, dynastic struggles caused the collapse of the Funan empire. It was succeeded by another Hindu-Khmer state, Chenla, which lasted until the 9th century. Then a Khmer king, Jayavarman II (about 800‚Äì850) established a capital at Angkor in central Cambodia. He founded a cult which identified the king with the Hindu God Shiva ‚Äì one of the triad of Hindu gods, Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, Shiva the god symbolising destruction and reproduction. The Angkor empire flourished from the 9th to the early 13th century. It reached the peak of its fame under Jayavarman VII at the end of the 12th century, when its conquests extended into Thailand in the west (where it had conquered the Mon kingdom of Dwaravati) and into Champa in the east. Its most celebrated memorial is the great temple of Angkor Wat, built early in the 12th century. This summarises the position on the South East Asian mainland until about the 12th century. Meanwhile, from about the 6th century, and until the 14th century, there was a series of great maritime empires based on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. In early days these Indians came mostly from the ancient kingdom of Kalinga, on the southeastern coast of India. Indians in Indonesia are still known as \"Klings\", derived from Kalinga.\n\n\n== East Timor ==\nThe later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, sandalwood, deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.\n\n\n=== Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Indianised Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire (7th - 12th century) ====\n\nOral traditions of people of Wehali principality of East Timor mention their migration from Sina Mutin Malaka or \"Chinese White Malacca\" (part of Indianised Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire) in ancient times.\n\n\n==== As a vassal of the Indianized Javanese Hindu empire of Majapahit (12th - 16th century) ====\n\nNagarakretagama, the chronicles of the Majapahit empire called Timor a tributary, but as Portuguese chronologist Tom√© Pires wrote in the 16th century, all islands east of Java were called \"Timor\". Indonesian nationalist used the Majapahit chronicles to claim East Timor as part of Indonesia.\n\n\n===== Trade with China =====\nTimor is mentioned in the 13th-century Chinese Zhu Fan Zhi, where it is called Ti-wu and is noted for its sandalwood. It is called Ti-men in the History of Song of 1345. Writing towards 1350, Wang Dayuan refers to a Ku-li Ti-men, which is a corruption of Giri Timor, meaning island of Timor. Giri from \"mountain\" in Sanskrit, thus \"mountainous island of Timor\".\n\n\n===== Chiefdoms or polities =====\n\nEarly European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century. One of the most significant is the Wehali or Wehale kingdom in central Timor, to which the Tetum, Bunak and Kemak ethnic groups were aligned.\n\n\n=== European colonisation and Christianisation (16th century onward) ===\nBeginning in the early sixteenth century, European colonialists‚Äîthe Dutch in the island's west, and Portuguese in the east‚Äîwould divide the island, isolating the East Timorese from the histories of the surrounding archipelago.\n\n\n== Indonesia ==\n\nApproximately for more than a millennia, between 5th to 15th centuries, the various Indianised states and empires flourished in the Indonesian archipelago; from the era of Tarumanagara to Majapahit. Though founded possibly by either early Indian settlers or by native polities that adopted Indian culture, and have maintaining diplomatic contacts with India, these archipelagic Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms remained politically independent from the kingdoms of Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n=== Srivijaya empire ===\nThe Indonesian archipelago saw the rise of Hindu-Buddhist empires of Sumatra and Java. In the islands of Southeast Asia, one of the first organised state to achieve fame was the Buddhist Malay kingdom of Srivijaya, with its capital at Palembang in southern Sumatra. Its commercial pre-eminence was based on command of the sea route from India to China between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula (later known as the Straits of Malacca). In the 6th ‚Äì 7th centuries Srivijaya succeeded Funan as the leading state in Southeast Asia. Its ruler was the overlord of the Malay Peninsula and western Java as well as Sumatra. During the era of Srivijaya, Buddhism became firmly entrenched there.\n\n\n=== Sailendra dynasty ===\n\nThe expansion of Srivijaya was resisted in eastern Java, where the powerful Buddhist Sailendra dynasty arose. From the 7th century onwards there was great activity in temple building in central Java. The most impressive of the ruins is at Borobudur, considered to have been the largest Buddhist temple in the world. Sailendra rule spread to southern Sumatra, and up to the Malay Peninsula to Cambodia (where it was replaced by the Angkorian kingdom). In the 9th century, the Sailendras moved to Sumatra, and a union of Srivijaya and the Sailendras formed an empire which dominated much of Southeast Asia for the next five centuries. After 500 Years of supremacy, Srivijaya was superseded by Majapahit.\n\n\n=== Mataram kingdom ===\n\nIn the 10th century, Mataram to the challenged the supremacy of Srivijaya, resulting in the destruction of the Mataram capital by Srivijaya early in the 11th century. Restored by King Airlangga (c. 1020‚Äì1050), the kingdom split on his death and the new state of Kediri was formed in eastern Java.\n\n\n=== Kediri kingdom ===\nKediri kingdom, spread its influence to the eastern part of Southeast Asia and became the centre of Javanese culture for the next two centuries. The spice trade was now becoming of increasing importance, as the demand by European countries for spices grew. Before they learned to keep sheep and cattle alive in the winter, they had to eat salted meat, made palatable by the addition of spices. One of the main sources was the Maluku Islands (or \"Spice Islands\") in Indonesia, and Kediri became a strong trading nation.\n\n\n=== Singhasari kingdom ===\nIn the 13th century, however, the Kediri dynasty was overthrown by a revolution, and Singhasari arose in east Java. The domains of this new state expanded under the rule of its warrior-king Kertanegara. He was killed by a prince of the previous Kediri dynasty, who then established the last great Hindu-Javanese kingdom, Majapahit.\n\n\n=== Majapahit empire ===\nWith the departure of the Sailendras and the fall of Singhasari, a new Majapahit kingdom appeared in eastern Java, which reverted from Buddhism to Hinduism. By the middle of the 14th century, Majapahit controlled most of Java, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, part of Borneo, the southern Celebes and the Moluccas. It also exerted considerable influence on the mainland.\n\n\n== Laos ==\n\n\n=== Funan kingdom ===\nThe first indigenous kingdom to emerge in Indochina was referred to in Chinese histories as the Kingdom of Funan and encompassed an area of modern Cambodia, and the coasts of southern Vietnam and southern Thailand since the 1st century CE. Funan was an Indianised kingdom,\nthat had incorporated central aspects of Indian institutions, religion, statecraft, administration, culture, epigraphy, writing and architecture and engaged in profitable Indian Ocean trade.\n\n\n=== Champa kingdom ===\nBy the 2nd century CE, Austronesian settlers had established an Indianised kingdom known as Champa along modern central Vietnam. The Cham people established the first settlements near modern Champasak in Laos. Funan expanded and incorporated the Champasak region by the sixth century CE, when it was replaced by its successor polity Chenla. Chenla occupied large areas of modern-day Laos as it accounts for the earliest kingdom on Laotian soil.\n\n\n=== Chenla kingdom ===\nThe capital of early Chenla was Shrestapura which was located in the vicinity of Champasak and the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Wat Phu. Wat Phu is a vast temple complex in southern Laos which combined natural surroundings with ornate sandstone structures, which were maintained and embellished by the Chenla peoples until 900 CE, and were subsequently rediscovered and embellished by the Khmer in the 10th century. By the 8th century CE Chenla had divided into \"Land Chenla\" located in Laos, and \"Water Chenla\" founded by Mahendravarman near Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia. Land Chenla was known to the Chinese as \"Po Lou\" or \"Wen Dan\" and dispatched a trade mission to the Tang dynasty court in 717 CE. Water Chenla, would come under repeated attack from Champa, the Medang sea kingdoms in Indonesia based in Java, and finally pirates. From the instability the Khmer emerged.\n\n\n=== Khmer kingdom ===\nUnder the king Jayavarman II the Khmer Empire began to take shape in the 9th century CE.\n\n\n=== Dvaravati city state kingdoms ===\nIn the area which is modern northern and central Laos, and northeast Thailand the Mon people established their own kingdoms during the 8th century CE, outside the reach of the contracting Chenla kingdoms. By the 6th century in the Chao Phraya River Valley, Mon peoples had coalesced to create the Dvaravati kingdoms. In the 8th century CE, Sri Gotapura (Sikhottabong) was the strongest of these early city states, and controlled trade throughout the middle Mekong region. The city states were loosely bound politically, but were culturally similar and introduced Therevada Buddhism from Sri Lankan missionaries throughout the region.\n\n\n== Malaysia ==\nThe Malay Peninsula was settled by prehistoric people 80,000 years ago. Another batch of peoples the deutro Malay migrated from southern China within 10,000 years ago. Upon arrival in the peninsula some of them mix with the Australoid. This gave the appearance of the Malays. It was suggested that the visiting ancient Dravidians named the peoples of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatera as \"Malay ur\" meant hills and city based on the geographical terrain of Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatera. Claudius Ptolemaeus (Greek: ŒöŒªŒ±œçŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ Œ†œÑŒøŒªŒµŒºŒ±·øñŒøœÇ; c. 90 ‚Äì c. 168), known in English as Ptolemy, was a Greek geographer, astronomer, and astrologer who had written about Golden Chersonese, which indicates trade with the Indian Sub-Continent and China has existed since the 1st century AD. Archeologist have found relic and ruin in Bujang Valley settlement dating back at 110AD. The settlement is believed to be the oldest civilization in Southeast Asia influenced by ancient Indians. Today, Malaysians of direct Indian descent account for approximately 7 per cent of the total population of Malaysia (approximately. 2 million) \nHinduism and Buddhism from India dominated early regional history, reaching their peak during the reign of the Sumatra-based Srivijaya civilisation, whose influence extended through Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula and much of Borneo from the 7th to the 13th centuries, which later gradually defeated and converted to Islam in 14th and 15th century before the European colonisation began in 16th century.\n\n\n=== Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (3rd century BCE to 14th century CE) ===\n\n\n==== Early trade and Indian settlements ====\nIn the first millennium CE, Malays became the dominant race on the peninsula. The small early states that were established were greatly influenced by Indian culture, as was most of Southeast Asia. Indian influence in the region dates back to at least the 3rd century BCE. Tamil culture was spread to Southeast Asia by the Tamil Pallava dynasty in the 4th and 5th century.\n\nIn ancient Indian literature, the term Suvarnadvipa or the \"Golden Peninsula\" is used in Ramayana, and some argued that it may be a reference to the Malay Peninsula. The ancient Indian text Vayu Purana also mentioned a place named Malayadvipa where gold mines may be found, and this term has been proposed to mean possibly Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. The Malay Peninsula was shown on Ptolemy's map as the \"Golden Khersonese\". He referred to the Straits of Malacca as Sinus Sabaricus.\nTrade relations with China and India were established in the 1st century BC. Shards of Chinese pottery have been found in Borneo dating from the 1st century following the southward expansion of the Han dynasty. In the early centuries of the first millennium, the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the Indian religions of Hinduism and Buddhism, religions which had a major effect on the language and culture of those living in Malaysia. The Sanskrit writing system was used as early as the 4th century.\n\n\n==== Indianised Hindu Malay kingdoms (3rd century to 7th century) ====\nThere were numerous Malay kingdoms in the 2nd and 3rd century, as many as 30, mainly based on the Eastern side of the Malay Peninsula. Among the earliest kingdoms known to have been based in the Malay Peninsula is the ancient kingdom of Langkasuka, located in the northern Malay Peninsula and based somewhere on the west coast. It was closely tied to Funan in Cambodia, which also ruled part of northern Malaysia until the 6th century. In the 5th century, the Kingdom of Pahang was mentioned in the Book of Song. According to the Sejarah Melayu (\"Malay Annals\"), the Khmer prince Raja Ganji Sarjuna founded the kingdom of Gangga Negara (modern-day Beruas, Perak) in the 700s. Chinese chronicles of the 5th century CE speak of a great port in the south called Guantoli, which is thought to have been in the Straits of Malacca. In the 7th century, a new port called Shilifoshi is mentioned, and this is believed to be a Chinese rendering of Srivijaya.\n\n\n==== Indianised Hindu-Buddhist Malay kingdoms as vassal of Srivijaya empire (7th - 13th century) ====\n\nBetween the 7th and the 13th century, much of the Malay Peninsula was under the Buddhist Srivijaya empire. The site of Srivijaya's centre is thought be at a river mouth in eastern Sumatra, based near what is now Palembang. For over six centuries the Maharajahs of Srivijaya ruled a maritime empire that became the main power in the archipelago. The empire was based around trade, with local kings (dhatus or community leaders) swearing allegiance to the central lord for mutual profit.\n\n\n===== Relationship of the Srivijaya empire with the Tamil Chola empire =====\n\nChola empire also had profound impact on Southeast Asia, who executed South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I and Chola invasion of Srivijaya.\nThe relation between Srivijaya and the Chola Empire of south India was friendly during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I but during the reign of Rajendra Chola I the Chola Empire invaded Srivijaya cities.\nIn 1025 and 1026 Gangga Negara was attacked by Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire, the Tamil emperor who is now thought to have laid Kota Gelanggi to waste. Kedah‚Äîknown as Kedaram, Cheh-Cha (according to I-Ching) or Kataha, in ancient Pallava or Sanskrit‚Äîwas in the direct route of the invasions and was ruled by the Cholas from 1025. A second invasion was led by Virarajendra Chola of the Chola dynasty who conquered Kedah in the late 11th century. The senior Chola's successor, Vira Rajendra Chola, had to put down a Kedah rebellion to overthrow other invaders. The coming of the Chola reduced the majesty of Srivijaya, which had exerted influence over Kedah, Pattani and as far as Ligor. During the reign of Kulothunga Chola I Chola overlordship was established over the Srivijaya province kedah in the late 11th century. The expedition of the Chola Emperors had such a great impression to the Malay people of the medieval period that their name was mentioned in the corrupted form as Raja Chulan in the medieval Malay chronicle Sejarah Melaya. Even today the Chola rule is remembered in Malaysia as many Malaysian princes have names ending with Cholan or Chulan, one such was the Raja of Perak called Raja Chulan.\n\nPattinapalai, a Tamil poem of the 2nd century CE, describes goods from Kedaram heaped in the broad streets of the Chola capital. A 7th-century Indian drama, Kaumudhimahotsva, refers to Kedah as Kataha-nagari. The Agnipurana also mentions a territory known as Anda-Kataha with one of its boundaries delineated by a peak, which scholars believe is Gunung Jerai. Stories from the Katasaritasagaram describe the elegance of life in Kataha. The Buddhist kingdom of Ligor took control of Kedah shortly after. Its king Chandrabhanu used it as a base to attack Sri Lanka in the 11th century and ruled the northern parts, an event noted in a stone inscription in Nagapattinum in Tamil Nadu and in the Sri Lankan chronicles, Mahavamsa.\n\n\n===== Decline of the Srivijaya empire and conflicts between its capital and its former vassal states (12th - 13th century) =====\nAt times, the Khmer kingdom, the Siamese kingdom, and even the Chola kingdom tried to exert control over the smaller Malay states. The power of Srivijaya declined from the 12th century as the relationship between the capital and its vassal states broke down. Wars with the Javanese caused it to request assistance from China, and it may have also waged wars with the Indian states. In the 11th century, the centre of power shifted to Malayu, a port which was possibly located further up the Sumatran coast near the Jambi River. The power of the Buddhist Maharajas was further undermined by the spread of Islam. Areas which were converted to Islam early, such as Aceh, broke away from Srivijaya's control. By the late 13th century, the Siamese kings of Sukhothai had brought most of Malaya under their rule. In the 14th century, the Hindu Java-based Majapahit empire came into possession of the peninsula.\n\n\n=== Defeat and conversion to Islamic sultanates in 14th and 15th century ===\nIn the 14th century that first Islamic sultanate was established. The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the Sultanate of Malacca. Islam had a profound influence on the Malay people. \n\n\n=== European colonisation and modern era (16th century - 20th century) ===\n\nThe Portuguese were the first European colonial powers to establish themselves on the Malay Peninsula and Southeast Asia, capturing Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641. However, it was the British who, after initially establishing bases at Jesselton, Kuching, Penang and Singapore, ultimately secured their hegemony across the territory that is now Malaysia. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 defined the boundaries between British Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies (which became Indonesia). A fourth phase of foreign influence was immigration of Chinese and Indian workers to meet the needs of the colonial economy created by the British in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo.\n\n\n== Philippines ==\n\n\n=== Indianised kingdoms in Philippines ===\n\nLuzon\nAround Manila and Pasig River were 3 polities which were earlier Hindu-Buddhist, later Islamic and then subsumed and converted to Catholicism by Spanish in 16th century\nNamayan\nMaynila (historical polity)\nRajah Sulayman (also Sulayman III, 1558‚Äì1575), Rajah of Maynila\nRajah Matanda (1480‚Äì1572), ruler of Maynila, together with Rajah Sulayman was co-ruled Maynila, their cousin Lakandula ruled Tondo.

His use of scorched earth tactics to repel invaders gave rise to the name Kang Sri Lumayang Sugbu (literally \"that of Sri Lumay's great fire\") to the town, which was later shortened to Sugbu (\"scorched earth\").\nSri Bantug, king and successor son of Sri Lumay\nRajah Humabon, king and successor son of Sri Batung\nBattle of Mactan on 27 April 1521 between Rajah Humabon and Ferdinand Magellan in which Lapulapu fought on side of Rajah, resulting in the death of Ferdinand Magellan.\nLapulapu, warrior under Rajah Humabon, Lapulapu fought Spanish\nFerdinand Magellan, Portuguese explorer on hired by Spanish empire\nRajah Tupas (Sri Tupas), nephew and successor of Rajah Humabon, last to rule the kingdom before subsumed by Spanish Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in the battle of Cebu during 1565.\nCaste system: Below the rulers were the Timawa, the feudal warrior class of the ancient Visayan societies of the Philippines who were regarded as higher than the uripon (commoners, serfs, and slaves) but below the Tumao (royal nobility) in the Visayan social hierarchy.

Lapu Lapu was a Timawa.\nA crude Buddhist medallion and a copper statue of a Hindu Deity, Ganesha, has been found by Henry Otley Beyer in 1921 in ancient sites in Puerto Princesa, Palawan and in Mactan, Cebu.

According to Majul, the origins of the title rajah sipad originated from the Hindu sri pada, which symbolises authority. The Principality was instituted and governed using the system of rajahs.

However, black and white photographs of these icons survive.\nMindanao\nGolden Tara (Agusan image) from Kingdom of Butuan in northeast Mindanao is a golden statue that was found in Agusan del Sur in northeast Mindanao.\n\n\n== Singapore ==\n\nThe Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy (90‚Äì168) identified a place called Sabana at the tip of Golden Chersonese (believed to be the Malay Peninsula) in the second and third century. The earliest written record of Singapore may be in a Chinese account from the third century, describing the island of Pu Luo Chung (Ëí≤ ÁæÖ ‰∏≠). This is thought to be a transcription from the Malay name \"Pulau Ujong\", or \"island at the end\" (of the Malay Peninsula).\nIn 1025 CE, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire led forces across the Indian Ocean and invaded the Srivijayan empire, attacking several places in Malaysia and Indonesia. The Chola forces were said to have controlled Temasek (now Singapore) for a couple of decades. The name Temasek however did not appear in Chola records, but a tale involving a Raja Chulan (assumed to be Rajendra Chola) and Temasek was mentioned in the semi-historical Malay Annals.\nThe Nagarakretagama, a Javanese eulogy written in 1365, referred to a settlement on the island called Tumasik (possibly meaning \"Sea Town\" or \"Sea Port\").\n\n\n=== Hindu-Buddhist kingdom (? - ~1511) ===\nThe name Temasek is also given in Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), which contains a tale of the founding of Temasek by a prince of Srivijaya, Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama) in the 13th century. Sri Tri Buana landed on Temasek on a hunting trip, and saw a strange beast said to be a lion. The prince took this as an auspicious sign and founded a settlement called Singapura, which means \"Lion City\" in Sanskrit. The actual origin of the name Singapura however is unclear according to scholars.\n\nIn 1320, the Mongol Empire sent a trade mission to a place called Long Ya Men (or Dragon's Teeth Gate), which is believed to be Keppel Harbour at the southern part of the island. The Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan, visiting the island around 1330, described Long Ya Men as one of the two distinct settlements in Dan Ma Xi (from Malay Temasek), the other being Ban Zu (from Malay pancur). Ban Zu is thought to be present day Fort Canning Hill, and recent excavations in Fort Canning found evidence indicating that Singapore was an important settlement in the 14th century. Wang mentioned that the natives of Long Ya Men (thought to be the Orang Laut) and Chinese residents lived together in Long Ya Men. Singapore is one of the oldest locations where a Chinese community is known to exist outside China, and the oldest corroborated by archaeological evidence.\nSometime in its history, the name of Temasek was changed to Singapura. The Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) contains a tale of a prince of Srivijaya, Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama), who landed on Temasek after surviving a storm in the 13th century. According to the tale, the prince saw a strange creature, which he was told was a lion; believing this to be an auspicious sign, he decided to found a settlement called Singapura, which means \"Lion City\" in Sanskrit. It is unlikely there ever were lions in Singapore, though tigers continued to roam the island until the early 20th century. However, the lion motif is common in Hindu mythology, which was dominant in the region during that period (one of the words for \"throne\" in the Malay language is \"singgasana\", meaning \"lion's seat\" in Sanskrit), and it has been speculated that the \"Singapura\" name, and the tale of the lion, were invented by court historians of the Malacca Sultanate to glorify Sang Nila Utama and his line of descent.\nDifferent versions of its history are told in Portuguese sources, suggesting that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara from Palembang. Historians believe that during the late 14th century, Parameswara, the last Srivijayan prince, fled to Temasek from Palembang after being deposed by the Majapahit Empire. According to Portuguese accounts, Parameswara killed the local chief with the title Sang Aji eight days after being welcomed into Temasek.\n\nBy the 14th century, the empire of Srivijaya had already declined, and Singapore was caught in the struggle between Siam (now Thailand) and the Java-based Majapahit Empire for control over the Malay Peninsula. According to the Malay Annals, Singapore was defeated in one Majapahit attack. The last king, Sultan Iskandar Shah (a prince of Srivijaya empire, his Hindu name Parameswara before he was converted to Islam) ruled the island for several years, before being forced to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. Portuguese sources however indicated that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara (thought to be the same person as Sultan Iskandar Shah) from Palembang, and Parameswara was then driven to Malacca, either by the Siamese or the Majapahit, where he founded the Malacca Sultanate. Modern archaeological evidence suggests that the settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards.\n\n\n=== Islamic sultanate (1511 - 1613) ===\nThe Malacca Sultanate extended its authority over the island and Singapore became a part of the Malacca Sultanate. However, by the time the Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century, Singapura had already become \"great ruins\" according to Alfonso de Albuquerque. In 1511, the Portuguese seized Malacca; the sultan of Malacca escaped south and established the Johor Sultanate, and Singapore then became part of the sultanate which was destroyed in 1613.\n\n\n=== British colony and modern era (19th century - present) ===\nThe Portuguese however destroyed the settlement in Singapore in 1613, and the island sank into obscurity for the next two centuries.\n\n\n== Thailand ==\n\n\n=== Propagation of Buddhism in Thailand by emperor Ashoka (3rd century BCE) ===\nHistorically, the cultural and economic interaction between the two countries can be traced to roughly around the 6th century B.C. The single most significant cultural contribution of India, for which Thailand is greatly indebted to India, is Buddhism. Propagated in Thailand in the 3rd century B.C. by Buddhist monks sent by King Asoka, it was adopted as the state religion of Thailand and has ruled the hearts and minds of Thais ever since. Presently 58,000,000 Thais, an overwhelming 94% of the total Thai populace adheres to Buddhism. However, direct contact can be said to have begun only in the 3rd century B.C. when King Asoka sent Buddhist monks to propagate Buddhism in the Indo-Chinese Peninsula. Besides Buddhism, Thailand has also adopted other typically Indian religious and cultural traditions. The ceremonies and rites especially as regards the Monarchy evidence a strong Hindu influence.\n\n\n=== Sukhothai period: Settlement of Indian traders and Brahmins in Thailand (1275‚Äì1350) ===\nThe Indians who moved into Thailand in the Sukhothai period (1275‚Äì1350) were either merchants who came to Siam or Thailand, for the purpose of trading or Brahmans who played an important role in the Siamese court as experts in astrology and in conducting ceremonies. The first group of Brahmans who entered Siam before the founding of Sukhothai as the first capital of Siam (1275‚Äì1350) popularized Hindu beliefs and traditions. During the Sukhothai period Brahman temples already existed. Brahmans conducted ceremonies in the court. The concepts of divine kingship and royal ceremonies are clear examples of the influence of Brahmanism.\nThe Coronation of the Thai monarch are practiced more or less in its original form even up to the present reign. The Thai idea that the king is a reincarnation of the Hindu deity Vishnu was adopted from Indian tradition. (Though this belief no longer exists today, the tradition to call each Thai king of the present Chakri dynasty Rama (Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu) with an ordinal number, such as Rama I, Rama II etc. is still in practice.)\n\n\n=== Ayutthaya period: Settlement of more Indian Tamil traders in Thailand (1350‚Äì1767 CE) ===\nIn the Ayutthaya kingdom era (1350‚Äì1767), more Tamil merchants entered the South of the country by boat as evidenced by the statues of Hindu gods excavated in the South.\n\n\n=== Later migration of Indians to Thailand (1855 CE - present day) ===\nAfter the year 1855, the Tamils who migrated to Thailand can be classified into three groups according to the religion they believed in, namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam.\n\n\n=== Indian cultural influence on Thailand ===\n\n\n==== Dance ====\nThai literature and drama draws great inspiration from Indian arts and legend. The Hindu epic of Ramayana is as popular in Thailand as it is in India. Thailand has adapted the Ramayana to suit the Thai lifestyle in the past and has come up with its own version of the Ramayana, namely, the Ramakien.\nTwo of the most popular classical dances the Khon, performed by men wearing ferocious masks, and the Lakhon (Lakhon nai, Lakhon chatri and Lakhon nok), performed by women who play both male and female roles draws inspiration primarily from the Ramakien. Percussion instruments and Piphat, a type of woodwind accompany the dance.\nIn addition, there are shadow play called nang talung in Thai. This is a show in which shadows of pieces of cow or water buffalo hide cut to represent human figures with movable arms and legs are thrown on a screen for the entertainment of spectators. In South India, this kind of show is called Bommalattam.\n\n\n==== Language ====\nThai language too bears close affinity with Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. An indication of the close linguistic affiliation between India and Thailand is found in common Thai words like Ratha Mantri, Vidhya, Samuthra, Karuna, Gulab, Prannee etc. which are almost identical to their Indian counterparts. Thai language basically consists of monosyllabic words that are individually complete in meaning. His Majesty King Ram Khamhaeng the Great created the Thai alphabet in 1283. He modeled it on the ancient Indian alphabets of Sanskrit and Pali through the medium of the old Khmer characters. Like most world languages, the Thai language is a complicated mixture derived from several sources. Many Thai words used today were derived from Pali, Sanskrit, Khmer, Malay, English and Chinese.\n\n\n==== Religious ceremonies and festivals ====\nSeveral Thai ceremonies have been adopted from Indian tradition. These include ceremonies related to ordination, marriage, merit making and cremation. Though the Buddha is the prime inspiration of Thailand, Brahma and other Hindu deities are widely worshipped among the Thais, due in part to the popularity of the Hindu ceremonial rites, which are used especially for royal ceremonies.\n(1) The Triyampawai Ceremony or the Giant Swing Ceremony. Originally a Brahmin ceremony performed to pay homage to the God Shiva, it was traditionally held front of Wat Suthat, while the King and Queen watched the ceremony from a gold silk pavilion. Though the ceremony was abolished during the reign of King Rama VII due to a severe economic fall, Brahman priests are still allocated money to make offerings to God Shiva.\n(2) The Royal Ploughing Ceremony, which is officiated by H.M. the king at Sanam Luang in May every year with pomp. Originally a Brahmanic rite, it was adopted to mark the beginning of the farming season as also to bless all farmers with fertility for the year.\n(3) The Royal Ceremony for preparing Celestial Rice or Khao thip which was said to be originally prepared by celestial beings in honor of God Indra. A portion of the celestial rice is offered to monks while the remainder was divided in varying quantities among the royal family, courtiers and household members. The making of the ambrosial dish has come to a natural end since custom demanded that virgins alone should perform the preparation and stirring of celestial rice.\n(4) The Kathina Ceremony or the period during which Buddhist monks receive new robes, which generally falls in the months of October- November.\n(5) Loy Krathong ‚Äì the Festival of Lights which is celebrated on the full moon night of the twelfth lunar month. The floating of Loi Krathong lanterns, which began in the Sukhothai Kingdom period, continued throughout the different stages of Thai history. The present day understanding is that the festival is celebrated as an act of worship to Chao Mae Kangka, the Goddess of the Waters, for providing the water much needed throughout the year, and as a way of asking forgiveness if they have polluted it or used it carelessly.\n(6) Songkran Festival: Songkran day marks Thai New Year day. \"Songkran\" signifies the sun's move into the first house of the zodiac. It is similar to Indian Holi and Makar Sankranti.\n(7) Visakha Puja Day which is considered as the greatest Buddhist holy day as it commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha.\nOther famous ceremonial holy days include Magha Puja day, in February and Asalha Puja day in July which commemorates the day on which the Buddha delivered the First Sermon to his five disciples, namely, Konthanya, Vassapa, Bhattiya, Mahanama and Assashi at Esipatanamaruekathayawan (Isipatana forest at Sarnath in India) and there explained his concept of the Four Noble Truths (Ariyasai).\n\n\n==== Hindu astrology ====\nHindu astrology still has a great impact on several important stages of Thai life. Thai people still seek advice from knowledgeable Buddhist monks or Brahman astrologers about the auspicious or inauspicious days for conducting or abstaining from ceremonies for moving house or getting married.\n\n\n==== Influence of Ayurveda on Thai traditional medicine and massage ====\nAccording to the Thai monk Venerable Buddhadasa Bhikku's writing, 'India's Benevolence to Thailand', the Thais also obtained the methods of making herbal medicines (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like sarabhi of family Guttiferae, kanika or harsinghar, phikun or Mimusops elengi and bunnak or the rose chestnut etc. were brought from India.\n\n\n==== Influence of Indian cuisine and spices on Thai cuisine ====\nThai monk Buddhadasa Bhikku's pointed out that Thai cuisine too was influenced by Indian cuisine. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use spices in their food in various ways from Indians.\n\n\n== Vietnam ==\n\n\n=== Early Chinese vassal states ===\nAt the eastern extremity of mainland Southeast Asia, northern Vietnam was originally occupied by Austro-Asiatic peoples. However, when regional power structures shifted Kra-Dai speaking tribes from Southern China began to settle in these lands. About 207 BC, Tri·ªáu ƒê√†, a Qin general, taking advantage of the temporary fragmentation of the Chinese Empire on the collapse of the Qin dynasty, created in northern Vietnam the kingdom of Nanyue. During the 1st century BC, Nanyue was incorporated in the Chinese Empire of the Han dynasty; and it remained a province of the empire until the fall of the Tang dynasty early in the 10th century. It then regained its independence, often as a nominal tributary kingdom of the Chinese emperor.\n\n\n=== Establishment of Indianised Hindu kingdom of Champa (10th century -) ===\nIn south-central Vietnam the Chams, a people of Austronesian stock, established the Hinduised kingdom of Champa c. 400. Subject to periodic invasions by the Annamese and by the Khmers of Cambodia, Champa survived and prospered. In 1471, a Vietnamese army of approximately 260,000, invaded Champa under Emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng (ÈªéËÅñÂÆó). The invasion began as a consequence of Cham King's Tr√† To√†n attack on Vietnam in 1470. The Vietnamese committed genocide against the Cham slaughtering approximately 60,000. The Vietnamese destroyed, burnt and raided massive parts of Champa, seizing the entire kingdom. Thousands of Cham escaped to Cambodia, the remaining were forced to assimilate into Vietnamese culture. Today, only 80,000 Cham remain in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Influence of Indian-origin Buddhism on Vietnam via Chinese culture ===\nVietnam, or then known as Annam (ÂÆâÂçó; pinyin: ƒÄnn√°n), experienced little Hindu influence ‚Äì usually via Champa. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries (except for Singapore and the Philippines), Vietnam was influenced by the Indian-origin religion Buddhism via the strong impact of culture of China.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpread of Indian influence\nGreater India\nIndosphere\nBuddhism in Southeast Asia\nHinduism in Southeast Asia\nIndianization of Southeast Asia\nTrading routes\nIndian maritime history\nSilk Road\nAncient maritime history\nOther related\nList of Southeast Asian leaders\nSoutheast Asian Games\nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization\nTiger Cub Economies\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nC≈ìd√®s, George (1968).

      "summary": "Southeast Asia was in the Indian sphere of cultural influence from 290 BCE to the 15th century CE, when Hindu-Buddhist influences were incorporated into local political systems. Kingdoms in the southeast coast of the Indian subcontinent had established trade, cultural and political relations with Southeast Asian kingdoms in Burma, Bhutan, Thailand, the Sunda Islands, Malay Peninsula, Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, and Champa. This led to the Indianisation and Sanskritisation of Southeast Asia within the Indosphere, Southeast Asian polities were the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist Mandala (polities, city states and confederacies).\nIndian culture itself arose from various distinct cultures and peoples, also including Austroasiatic lingusitic influence onto early Indians. However some scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and L√©vi, concluded that not only linguistic but there are also some cultural, and even political Austroasiatic influence on early Indian culture and traditions. India is seen a melting pot of western, eastern and indigenous traditions. This distinctly Indian cultural system was later adopted and assimilated into the indigenous social construct and statehood of Southeast Asian regional polity, which rulers gained power and stability, transforming small chieftains into regional powers.\nUnlike the other kingdoms which existed on the Indian subcontinent, the Pallava empire which ruled the southeastern coast of the Indian peninsula did not impose cultural restrictions on people who wished to cross the sea. The Chola empire, which executed the South-East Asian campaign of Rajendra Chola I and the Chola invasion of Srivijaya, profoundly impacted Southeast Asia. This impact led to more exchanges with Southeast Asia on the sea routes. Whereas Buddhism thrived and became the main religion in many countries of Southeast Asia, it became a minority religion in India.\nThe peoples of maritime Southeast Asia ‚Äî present-day Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines ‚Äî are thought to have migrated southward from South China sometime between 2500 and 1500 BC. The influence of the civilization which existed on the Indian Subcontinent gradually became predominant among them, and it also became predominant among the peoples which lived on the Southeast Asian mainland.\nSouthern Indian traders, adventurers, teachers and priests continued to be the dominating influences in Southeast Asia until about 1500 CE. Hinduism and Buddhism both spread to these states from India and for many centuries, they existed there with mutual toleration. Eventually the states of the mainland mainly became Buddhist.\n\n",

      "title": "History of Tamil Nadu",
      "content": "The region of Tamil Nadu in the southeast of modern India, shows evidence of having had continuous human habitation from 15,000 BCE to 10,000 BCE. Throughout its history, spanning the early Upper Paleolithic age to modern times, this region has coexisted with various external cultures.\nThe three ancient Tamil dynasties namely Chera, Chola, and Pandya were of ancient origins. Together they ruled over this land with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in the world. These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other vying for hegemony over the land. Invasion by the Kalabhras during the 3rd century disturbed the traditional order of the land, displacing the three ruling kingdoms. These occupiers were overthrown by the resurgence of the Pandyas and the Pallavas, who restored the traditional kingdoms. The Cholas who re-emerged from obscurity in the 9th century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas rose to become a great power and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula. At its height the Chola empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km¬≤ (1,389,968 sq mi) straddling the Bay of Bengal. The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia.\nRapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest and the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the 14th century. Despite this, the Vijayanagara Empire gained a foothold in the region from the late 14th century until the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha Empire expanded its territories into the northern regions of present-day Tamil Nadu. The Madras Presidency, comprising most of southern India, was created in the late 18th century and was ruled directly by the British. After the independence of India, after the Telugu and Malayalam parts of Madras state were separated from Tamilagam state in 1956, it was renamed as Tamil Nadu on January 14, 1969, by the state government.\n\n\n== Prehistoric period ==\n\n\n=== Palaeolithic ===\nFor most of the Lower Palaeolithic stage, pre-modern humans lived close to river valleys with sparse forest cover or in grassland environments. The population density was very low and so far only two localities of this lower Palaeolithic culture have been found in south India. Pre-modern humans in South India, belonging to the species of Homo erectus, lived in this primitive 'old stone age' (Palaeolithic) for quite a long time, using only crude implements such as hand axes and choppers and subsisting as hunter-gatherers.\nIn Attirampakkam, archaeologists from the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education excavated ancient stone tools which suggests that a human-like population existed in the Tamil Nadu region somewhere around 300,000 years before homo sapiens arrived from Africa.\nA discovery of a rare fossilized baby brain in Viluppuram district, by a team of archaeologists was reported in April 2003, It is estimated to be about 187,000 years - 200,000 years or older. The ancestor of modern humans (Homo sapiens) who appeared around 50,000 years ago was more developed and could make thinner flake tools and blade-like tools using a variety of stones. From about 10,000 years ago, humans made still smaller tools called Microlithic tools. The material used by the early humans to make these tools were jasper, agate, flint, quartz, etc. In 1949, researchers found such microliths in Tirunelveli district. Archaeological evidence suggests that the microlithic period lasted between 6000‚Äì3000 BCE.\n\n\n=== Neolithic ===\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Neolithic period had its advent around 2500 BCE. Humans of the Neolithic period made their stone tools in finer shapes by grinding and polishing. A Neolithic axe head with ancient writing on it has been found in North Tamil Nadu Near Palar river. The Neolithic humans lived mostly on small flat hills or on the foothills in small, more or less permanent settlements but for periodical migration for grazing purposes. They gave the dead proper burials within urns or pits. They were also starting to use copper for making certain tools or weapons.\n\n\n=== Iron Age ===\nDuring the Iron Age humans started using iron for making tools and weapons. The Iron Age culture in peninsular India is marked by Megalithic burial sites, which are found in several hundreds of places. On the basis of both some excavations and the typology of the burial monuments, it has been suggested that there was a gradual spread of the Iron Age sites from the north to the south.  Comparative excavations carried out in Adichanallur in Thirunelveli District and in Northern India have provided evidence of a southward migration of the Megalithic culture.\nThe earliest clear evidence of the presence of the megalithic urn burials are those dating from around 1800 BCE, which have been discovered at various places in Tamil Nadu, notably at Adichanallur, 24 km from Tirunelveli, where archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India unearthed 157 urns, including 15 containing human skulls, skeletons and bones, plus husks, grains of rice, charred rice and Neolithic Celts. One urn has writing inside, which, according to archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India, resembles early Tamil-Brahmi script, confirming it of the Neolithic period 2800 years ago. Adhichanallur has been announced as an archaeological site for further excavation and studies.\nMentions of the political situation of Tamil Nadu before the common era are found in Ashoka's edicts dated c.3rd century BCE and, vaguely, in the Hathigumpha inscription dated c.2nd century BCE.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nAncient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states, headed by kings called Vendhar and several tribal chieftaincies, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination Vel or Velir. Still lower at the local level there were clan chiefs called kizhar or mannar. During the 3rd century BCE, the Deccan was part of the Maurya Empire, and from the middle of the 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE the same area was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty. The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires. The Tamil kings and chiefs were always in conflict with each other mostly over the property. The royal courts were mostly places of social gathering rather than places of dispensation of authority; they were centres for distribution of resources. Tamil literature Tolkappiyam sheds some light on early religion. Gradually the rulers came under the influence of Vedic beliefs, which encouraged performance of sacrifices to enhance the status of the ruler. Buddhism, Jainism and Ajivika co-existed with early Shaivite, Vaishnavism and Shaktism during the first five centuries.\nThe names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras, are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273‚Äì232 BCE) inscriptions, among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him. The king of Kalinga, Kharavela, who ruled around 150 BCE, mentioned in the famous Hathigumpha inscription of the confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms that had existed for over 100 years.\n\nKarikala Chola was the most famous early Chola. He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Sangam poetry. Purananuru poem 224 mentions him as a great king who performed Vedic Sacrifices. In later times Karikala was the subject of many legends found in the Cilappatikaram and in inscriptions and literary works of the 11th and 12th centuries. They attribute to him the conquest of the whole of India up to the Himalayas and the construction of the flood banks of the river Kaveri with the aid of his feudatories. These legends, however, are conspicuous by their absence in the Sangam poetry. Kocengannan was another famous early Chola king who has been extolled in a number of poems of the Sangam period. He was even made a Saiva saint during the medieval period.\nPandyas ruled initially from Korkai, a seaport on the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas are also mentioned in Sangam Literature, as well as by Greek and Roman sources during this period. Megasthenes in his Indika mentions the Pandyan kingdom. The Pandyas controlled the present districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli, and parts of south Kerala. They had trading contacts with Greece and Rome. With the other kingdoms of Tamilakam, they maintained trading contacts and marital relationships with Tamil merchants from Eelam. Various Pandya kings find mention in a number of poems in the Sangam literature. Among them, Nedunjeliyan, 'the victor of Talaiyalanganam' deserves a special mention. Besides several short poems found in the Akananuru and the Purananuru collections, there are two major works‚ÄîMathuraikkanci and the Netunalvatai (in the collection of Pattupattu) that give a glimpse into the society and commercial activities in the Pandyan kingdom during the Sangam age. The early Pandyas went into obscurity at the end of the 3rd century CE during the incursion of the Kalabhras.\nThe kingdom of the Cheras comprised the modern Western Tamil Nadu and Kerala, along the western or Malabar Coast of southern India. Their proximity to the sea favoured trade with Africa. Chera rulers dated to the first few centuries AD. It records the names of the kings, the princes, and the court poets who extolled them. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present, a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived. Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan Chera are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems. Senguttuvan Chera, the most celebrated Chera king, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the Tamil epic Silapathikaram.\nThese early kingdoms sponsored the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in Tamil. The classical Tamil literature, referred to as Sangam literature is attributed to the period between 500 BCE and 300 CE. The poems of Sangam literature, which deal with emotional and material topics, were categorised and collected into various anthologies during the medieval period. These Sangam poems paint the picture of a fertile land and of a people who were organised into various occupational groups. The governance of the land was through hereditary monarchies, although the sphere of the state's activities and the extent of the ruler's powers were limited through the adherence to the established order (dharma). The people were loyal to their kings and roving bards, musicians and dancers gathered at the royal courts of the generous kings. The arts of music and dancing were highly developed and popular. Musical instruments of various types are mentioned in the Sangam poems. The amalgamation of the southern and the northern styles of dancing started during this period and is reflected fully in the epic Cilappatikaram.\nInternal and external trade was well organised and active. Evidence from both archaeology and literature speaks of a flourishing foreign trade with the Yavanas (Greeks). The port city of Puhar on the east coast and Muziris on the west coast of south India were emporia of foreign trade, where huge ships moored, offloading precious merchandise. This trade started to decline after the 2nd century CE and the direct contact between the Roman empire and the ancient Tamil country was replaced by trade with the Arabs and the Auxumites of East Africa. Internal trade was also brisk and goods were sold and bartered. Agriculture was the main profession of a vast majority of the populace.\n\n\n== Interregnum (300‚Äì600) ==\n\nAfter the close of the Sangam era, from about 300 to about 600 CE, there was an almost total lack of information regarding occurrences in the Tamil land. Some time about 300 CE, the whole region was upset by the appearance of the Kalabhras. These people are described in later literature as 'evil rulers' who overthrew the established Tamil kings and got a stranglehold of the country. information about their origin and details about their reign is scarce. They did not leave many artifacts or monuments. The only source of information on them is the scattered mentions in Buddhist and Jain literature.\nHistorians speculate that these people followed Buddhist or Jain faiths and were antagonistic towards the Hindu religions (viz. the Astika schools) adhered by the majority of inhabitants of the Tamil region during the early centuries CE. As a result, Hindu scholars and authors who followed their decline in the 7th and 8th century may have expunged any mention of them in their texts and generally tended to paint their rule in a negative light. It is perhaps due to this reason, the period of their rule is known as a 'Dark Age'‚Äîan interregnum. Some of the ruling families migrated northwards and found enclaves for themselves away from the Kalabhras. Jainism and Buddhism, took deep roots in the society, giving birth to a large body of ethical poetry.\nWriting became very widespread and vatteluttu evolved from the Tamil-Brahmi became a mature script for writing Tamil. While several anthologies were compiled by collecting bardic poems of earlier centuries, some of the epic poems such as the Cilappatikaram and didactic works such as the Tirukkural were also written during this period. The patronage of the Jain and Buddhist scholars by the Kalabhra kings influenced the nature of the literature of the period, and most of the works that can be attributed to this period were written by the Jain and Buddhist authors. In the field of dance and music, the elite started patronising new polished styles, partly influenced by northern ideas, in the place of the folk styles. A few of the earliest rock-cut temples belong to this period. Brick temples (known as kottam, devakulam, and palli) dedicated to various deities are referred to in literary works. Kalabhras were displaced around the 7th century by the revival of Pallava and Pandya power.\nEven with the exit of the Kalabhras, the Jain and Buddhist influence still remained in Tamil Nadu. The early Pandya and the Pallava kings were followers of these faiths. The Hindu reaction to this apparent decline of their religion was growing and reached its peak during the later part of the 7th century. There was a widespread Hindu revival during which a huge body of Saiva and Vaishnava literature was created. Many Saiva Nayanmars and Vaishnava Alvars provided a great stimulus to the growth of popular devotional literature. Karaikkal Ammaiyar who lived in the 6th century CE was the earliest of these Nayanmars. The celebrated Saiva hymnists Sundaramurthi, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Thirunavukkarasar were of this period. Vaishnava Alvars such as Poigai Alvar, Bhoothathalvar and Peyalvar produced devotional hymns for their faith and their songs were collected later into the four thousand poems of Naalayira Divyap Prabhandham.\n\n\n== Age of empires (600‚Äì1300) ==\nThe medieval period of the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some of whom went on to the extent of empires, exerting influences both in India and overseas. The Cholas who were very active during the Sangam age were entirely absent during the first few centuries. The period started with the rivalry between the Pandyas and the Pallavas, which in turn caused the revival of the Cholas. The Cholas went on to become a great power. Their decline saw the brief resurgence of the Pandyas. This period was also that of the re-invigorated Hinduism during which temple building and religious literature were at their best.\nThe Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became dominant, replacing the prevalence of Jainism and Buddhism of the previous era. Saivism was patronised more by the Chola kings and became more or less a state religion. Some of the earliest temples that are still standing were built during this period by the Pallavas. The rock-cut temples in Mamallapuram and the majestic Kailasanatha and Vaikuntaperumal temples of Kanchipuram stand testament to the Pallava art. The Cholas, utilising their prodigious wealth earned through their extensive conquests, built long-lasting stone temples including the great Brihadisvara temple of Thanjavur and exquisite bronze sculptures. Temples dedicated to Siva and Vishnu received liberal donations of money, jewels, animals, and land, and thereby became powerful economic institutions. Mutharaiyar who ruled the central part of Tamil Nadu between 600 - 900 CE.  The Cauvery Delta regions were mostly ruled by the Muthraiyar Kings having Woraiyur as their Capital.  Vijayalayachola conquered Tanjore from Dhancheya Muhuraiyar King who established the Tanjore City.  Among the noted Muthariyar King, Perumbidugu alias Swaran Maran Muthraiyar who conquered consequently 14 battles and known as the Emperor in Tamil Nadu (Perarasar).  He and his ancestors built many cave temples in Tiruchirappalli and Pudukottai regions.  Among them Kuvavan Sathan alias Videl Vidugu Muthraiyar built many cave temples in Pudukottai Region.  Mutharaiyars and ancestors are known as Muthuraja in central of part of Tamil Nadu particularly Tiruchirappalli.\nTamil script replaced the vatteluttu script throughout Tamil Nadu for writing Tamil. Religious literature flourished during the period. The Tamil epic, Kamban's Ramavatharam, was written in the 13th century. A contemporary of Kamban was the famous poet Auvaiyar who found great happiness in writing for young children. The secular literature was mostly court poetry devoted to the eulogy of the rulers. The religious poems of the previous period and the classical literature of the Sangam period were collected and systematised into several anthologies. Sanskrit was patronised by the priestly groups for religious rituals and other ceremonial purposes. Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of Rajaraja Chola I, collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called Tirumurais. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in Periyapuranam by Sekkilar, who lived during the reign of Kulothunga Chola II (1133‚Äì1150 CE). Jayamkondar's Kalingattupparani, a semi-historical account on the two invasions of Kalinga by Kulothunga Chola I was an early example of a biographical work.\n\n\n=== Pallavas ===\n\n \n\nThe 7th century Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son Mamalla  Narasimhavarman I. The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the 2nd century. It has been widely accepted by scholars that they were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings. After the fall of the Satavahanas, they began to get control over parts of Andhra and the Tamil country. Later they had marital ties with the Vishnukundina who ruled over the Deccan. It was around 550 CE under King Simhavishnu that the Pallavas emerged into prominence. They subjugated the Cholas and reigned as far south as the Kaveri River.\nThe Pallavas were at their finest during the reigns of Narasimhavarman I and Pallavamalla Nandivarman II. Pallavas ruled a large portion of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. Dravidian architecture during the Pallava rule includes the Shore Temple, built for Narasimhavarman II, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many sources describe Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen school of Buddhism in China, as a prince of the Pallava dynasty.  Alongside Bodhidharma, another monk, Vajrabodhi is said to have been the son of a Tamil aristocrat, travelled from Tamil Nadu to the Tang capital of Chang'an, via Sri Lanka and Srivijaya, after mastering the art of Tantric Buddhism. He took a plethora of new theological beliefs to a China that was largely following Confucianism or Daoism. Vajrabodhi's contribution to the growth of Tantric Buddhism in China has been recorded by one of his lay disciples, L√º Xiang.\nDuring the 6th and the 7th centuries, the western Deccan saw the rise of the Chalukyas based in Vatapi. Pulakeshin II (c.610‚Äì642) invaded the Pallava kingdom in the reign of Mahendravarman I. Narasimhavarman who succeeded Mahendravarman mounted a counter invasion of the Chalukya country and captured the Chalukyan capital Vatapi and ruled it for 12 years. The rivalry between the Chalukyas and the Pallavas continued for another 100 years until the demise of the Chalukyas around 750. The Chalukyas and Pallavas fought numerous battles and the Pallava capital Kanchipuram was occupied by Vikramaditya II during the reign of Nandivarman II. Nandivarman II had a very long reign (732‚Äì796). He led an expedition to the Ganga kingdom (south Mysore) in 760. Pallavas were also in constant conflict with the Pandyas and their frontier shifted along the river Kaveri. The Pallavas had the more difficult existence of the two as they had to fight on two fronts‚Äîagainst the Pandyas as well as the Chalukyas.\n\n\n=== Pandyas ===\n\nPandya Kadungon (560‚Äì590) is credited with the overthrow of the Kalabhras in the south. Kadungon and his son Maravarman Avanisulamani revived the Pandya power. Pandya Cendan extended their rule to the Chera country. His son Arikesari Parantaka Maravarman (c. 650‚Äì700) had a long and prosperous rule. He fought many battles and extended the Pandya power. Pandya was well known since ancient times, with contacts, even diplomatic, reaching the Roman Empire; during the 13th century, Marco Polo mentioned it as the richest empire in existence.\nThe Pandyan Empire was large enough to pose a serious threat to the Pallava power. Pandya Maravarman Rajasimha aligned with the Chalukya Vikramaditya II and attacked the Pallava king Nandivarman II. Varagunan I defeated the Pallavas in a battle on the banks of the Kaveri. The Pallava king Nandivarman sought to restrain the growing power of the Pandyas and went into an alliance with the feudal chieftains of Kongu and Chera countries. The armies met in several battles and the Pandya forces scored decisive victories in them.  Pandyas under Srimara Srivallaba also invaded Sri Lanka and devastated the northern provinces in 840.\nThe Pandya power continued to grow under Srimara and encroached further into the Pallava territories. The Pallavas were now facing a new threat in the form of the Rashtrakutas who had replaced the Chalukyas in the western Deccan. However, the Pallavas found an able monarch in Nandivarman III, who with the help of his Ganga and Chola allies defeated Srimara at the Battle of Tellaru. The Pallava kingdom again extended up to the river Vaigai. The Pandyas suffered further defeats at the hands of the Pallava Nripatunga at Arisil (c. 848). From then the Pandyas had to accept the overlordship of the Pallavas.\n\n\n=== Cholas ===\n\nAround 850, out of obscurity rose Vijayalaya Chola,  the successor of Srikantha Chola made use of an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas, captured Thanjavur from Mutharaiyar dynasty and eventually established the imperial line of the medieval Cholas. Vijayalaya revived the Chola dynasty and his son Aditya I helped establish their independence. He invaded Pallava kingdom in 903 and killed the Pallava king Aparajita in battle, ending the Pallava reign. The Chola kingdom under Parantaka I expanded to cover the entire Pandya country. However, towards the end of his reign, he suffered several reverses by the Rashtrakutas who had extended their territories well into the Chola kingdom.\n\nThe Cholas went into a temporary decline during the next few years due to weak kings, palace intrigues and succession disputes. Despite a number of attempts, the Pandya country could not be completely subdued and the Rashtrakutas were still a powerful enemy in the north. However, the Chola revival began with the accession of Rajaraja Chola I in 985.  Cholas rose as a notable military, economic and cultural power in Asia under Rajaraja and his son Rajendra Chola I. The Chola territories stretched from the islands of Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the river Ganges in Bengal. Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of Maldives. Rajendra Chola extended the Chola conquests to the Malayan archipelago by defeating the Srivijaya kingdom. He defeated Mahipala, the king of Bihar and Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital called Gangaikonda Cholapuram (the town of Cholas who conquered the Ganges). At its peak, the Chola Empire extended from the island of Sri Lanka in the south to the Godavari basin in the north. The kingdoms along the east coast of India up to the river Ganges acknowledged Chola suzerainty. Chola navies invaded and conquered Srivijaya in the Malayan archipelago. Chola armies exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia. During the reign of Rajaraja and Rajendra, the administration of the Chola empire matured considerably. The empire was divided into a number of self-governing local government units, and the officials were selected through a system of popular elections.\n\nThroughout this period, the Cholas were constantly troubled by the ever-resilient Sinhalas trying to overthrow the Chola occupation of Lanka, Pandya princes trying to win independence for their traditional territories, and by the growing ambitions of the Chalukyas in the western Deccan. The history of this period was one of constant warfare between the Cholas and of these antagonists. A balance of power existed between the Chalukyas and the Cholas and there was a tacit acceptance of the Tungabhadra river as the boundary between the two empires. However, the bone of contention between these two powers was the growing Chola influence in the Vengi kingdom. The Cholas and Chalukyas fought many battles and both kingdoms were exhausted by the endless battles and a stalemate existed.\nMarital and political alliances between the Eastern Chalukya kings based around Vengi located on the south banks of the river Godavari began during the reign of Rajaraja following his invasion of Vengi. Virarajendra Chola's son Athirajendra Chola was assassinated in a civil disturbance in 1070 and Kulothunga Chola I ascended the Chola throne starting the Chalukya Chola dynasty. Kulothunga was a son of the Vengi king Rajaraja Narendra. The Chalukya Chola dynasty saw very capable rulers in Kulothunga Chola I and Vikrama Chola, however, the eventual decline of the Chola power practically started during this period. The Cholas lost control of the island of Lanka and were driven out by the revival of Sinhala power. Around 1118 they also lost control of Vengi to Western Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI and Gangavadi (southern Mysore districts) to the growing power of Hoysala Vishnuvardhana, a Chalukya feudatory. In the Pandya territories, the lack of a controlling central administration caused a number of claimants to the Pandya throne to cause a civil war in which the Sinhalas and the Cholas were involved by proxy. During the last century of the Chola existence, a permanent Hoysala army was stationed in Kanchipuram to protect them from the growing influence of the Pandyas. Rajendra Chola III was the last Chola king. The Kadava chieftain Kopperunchinga I even captured Rajendra and held him prisoner. At the close of Rajendra's reign (1279), the Pandyan empire was at the height of prosperity and had completely absorbed the Chola kingdom.\nThe Cholas also found a place in the very famous novel by Kalki titled Ponniyin Selvan which portrays the whole Chola history with Rajaraja Cholan ( Ponniyin Selvan, Arul Mozhi Varman, Vallavarayan Vanthiyaththevan, Karikalar, Nandhini, Kundhavi) as the characters of the novel.\n\n\n=== Cheras ===\nThe Cheras were an ancient Dravidian royal dynasty of Tamil origin who ruled in regions of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in India. Together with the Chola and the Pandyas, it formed the three principal warring Iron Age kingdoms of southern India in the early centuries of the Common Era. over a wide area comprising Venad, Kuttanad, Kudanad, Pazhinad, and more. In other words, they governed the area between Alappuzha in the south to Kasargod in the north. This included Palghat, Coimbatore, Salem, and Kollimalai. The capital was Vanchi, which the Romans who actively traded with the Cheras knew as Muzris.\n\nBy the early centuries of the Common Era, civil society and statehood under the Cheras were developed in present-day western Tamil Nadu. The location of the Chera capital is generally assumed to be at modern Karur (identified with the Korra of Ptolemy). The Chera kingdom later extended to the plains of Kerala, the Palghat gap, along the river Perar and occupied land between the river Perar and river Periyar, creating two harbour towns, Tondi (Tyndis) and Muciri (Muziris), where the Roman trade settlements flourished.\nThe Cheras were in continuous conflict with the neighboring Cholas and Pandyas. The Cheras are said to have defeated the combined armies of the Pandyas and the Cholas and their ally states. They also made battles with the KadambƒÅs of Banavasi and the Yavanas (the Greeks) on the Indian coast. After the 2nd century AD, the Cheras' power decayed rapidly with the decline of the lucrative trade with the Romans.\nThe Tamil poetic collection called Sangam literature describes a long line of Chera rulers dated to the first few centuries AD. It records the names of the kings, the princes, and the court poets who extolled them. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present, a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived. Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan Chera are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems. Senguttuvan Chera, the most celebrated Chera king, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the Tamil epic Silapathikaram.\nThe Chera kingdom owed its importance to trade with West Asia, Greece, and Rome. Its geographical advantages, like the abundance of exotic spices, the navigability of the rivers connecting the Ghat mountains with the Arabian Sea, and the discovery of favorable Monsoon winds which carried sailing ships directly from the Arabian coast to Chera kingdom, combined to produce a veritable boom in the Chera foreign trade.\nThe Later Cheras ruled from the 9th century. Little is known about the Cheras between the two dynasties. The second dynasty, Kulasekharas ruled from a city on the banks of River Periyar called Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur). Though never regained the old status in the Peninsula, Kulasekharas fought numerous wars with their powerful neighbors and diminished to history in the 12th century as a result of continuous Chola and Rashtrakuta invasions. The Chera Dynasty was supported by Tamil warriors such as Villavar, Vanavar and Malayar clans.\nThe Chera rulers of Venadu, based at the port Quilon in southern Kerala, trace their relations back to the later/second Cheras. Ravi Varma Kulasekhara, ruler of Venadu from 1299 to 1314, is known for his ambitious military campaigns to former Pandya and Chola territories.\n\n\n=== Pandya revival ===\nAfter being overshadowed by the Pallavas and Cholas for centuries, the Pandiyas revived their fortunes in the 13th century and the Pandya power extended from the Telugu territories along the banks of the Godavari river to the northern half of Sri Lanka. When Kulasekara Pandyan I died in 1308, a conflict stemming from succession disputes arose amongst his sons ‚Äì the legitimate Sundara Pandya and the illegitimate Vira Pandya (who was favoured by the king) fought each other for the throne. Soon Madurai fell into the hands of the invading armies of the Delhi Sultanate (which initially gave protection to the vanquished Sundara Pandyan).\n\n\n=== Delhi Sultanate ===\n\nMalik Kafur, a general of the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji invaded and sacked Madurai in 1311. Pandyas and their descendants were confined to a small region around Tirunelveli for a few more years. Ravivarman Kulasekara (r. 1299‚Äì1314), a Chera (Perumal) feudatory of Kulasekara Pandya, staked his claim to the Pandya throne. Ravivarman, utilizing the unsettled nature of the country, quickly overran the southern Tamil Nadu and brought the entire region from Kanyakumari to Kanchipuram, under the Chera kingdom. His inscription was found in Punaamalli, a suburb of Madras. But, Ravivarman's hold over Kanchi was only short-lived and his aggressive activities were arrested by the KƒÅkatiya ruler, PratƒÅparudra II. The KƒÅkatiya army under the command of Muppidi NƒÅyaka marched to Kanchi and captured the city.\n\n\n== Vijayanagar and Nayak period (1300‚Äì1650) ==\n\nThe 14th-century invasion by the Delhi Sultans caused a retaliatory reaction from the Hindus, who rallied to build a new kingdom, called the Vijayanagara Empire. Bukka, with his brother Harihara, founded the Vijayanagara Empire based in the city of Vijayanagara in Karnataka. Under Bukka the empire prospered and continued to expand towards the south. Bukka and his son Kampana conquered most of the kingdoms of southern India. In 1371 the Vijayanagar empire defeated the short-lived Madurai Sultanate, which had been established by the remnants of the invading Khalji army. Eventually the empire covered the entire south India. Vijayanagara empire established local governors called Nayaks to rule in the various territories of the empire.\n\nThe Vijayanagar Empire declined in 1565 defeated by the Deccan sultans in the Battle of Talikota. The local Nayak governors declared their independence and started their rule. The Nayaks of Madurai and Thanjavur were the most prominent of them. Ragunatha Nayak (1600‚Äì1645) was the greatest of the Tanjavur Nayaks. Raghunatha Nayak encouraged trade and permitted a Danish settlement in 1620 at Tarangambadi. This laid the foundation of future European involvement in the affairs of the country. The success of the Dutch inspired the English to seek trade with Thanjavur, which was to lead to far-reaching repercussions.  Vijaya Raghava (1631‚Äì1676) was the last of the Thanjavur Nayaks.  Nayaks reconstructed some of the oldest temples in the country and their contributions can be seen even today. Nayaks expanded the existing temples with large pillared halls, and tall gateway towers, which is representative of the religious architecture of this period.\nIn Madurai, Thirumalai Nayak was the most famous Nayak ruler. He patronised art and architecture creating new structures and expanding the existing landmarks in and around Madurai. On Thirumalai Nayak's death in 1659, the Madurai Nayak kingdom began to break up. His successors were weak rulers and invasions of Madurai recommenced. The Nayakas manned their forces with primarily Kallar and Marava warriors.\n\n\n== Tondaiman period (1680‚Äì1948) ==\nPudukkottai was a kingdom and later a princely state in British India, which existed from 1680 until 1948. It was one of the very few regions of Tamil Nadu not to be colonized by the British. The Kingdom of Pudukkottai was founded in about 1680 as a feudatory of Ramnad and grew with subsequent additions from Tanjore, Sivaganga and Ramnad. One of the staunch allies of the British East India Company in the Carnatic, Anglo-Mysore and Polygar Wars, the kingdom was brought under the Company's protection in 1800 as per the system of Subsidiary Alliance. The state was placed under the control of the Madras Presidency from 1800 until 1 October 1923, when the Madras States Agency was abolished, and until 1948 it was under the political control of the Government of India.\nPudukkottai State covered a total area of 1,178 square miles (3,050 km2) and had a population of 438,648 in 1941. It extended over the whole of the present-day Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu (with the exception of Aranthangi taluk which was then a part of Tanjore district). The town of Pudukkottai was its capital.\nList of kings of Pudukkottai\n\nRaghunatha Raya Tondaiman (1686‚Äì1730)\nVijaya Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman I (1730‚Äì1769)\nRaya Raghunatha Tondaiman (1769‚Äì December 1789)\nVijaya Raghunatha Tondaiman (December 1789 ‚Äì 1 February 1807)\nVijaya Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman II (1 February 1807 ‚Äì June 1825)\nRaghunatha Tondaiman (June 1825 ‚Äì 13 July 1839)\nRamachandra Tondaiman (13 July 1839 ‚Äì 15 April 1886)\nMartanda Bhairava Tondaiman (15 April 1886 ‚Äì 28 May 1928)\nRajagopala Tondaiman (28 October 1928 ‚Äì 1 March 1948)\n\n\n== Maratha influences (1676‚Äì1855) ==\n\nIn 1676, Shivaji Bhonsle, the first Maratha Chhatrapati, started a campaign in present-day Tamil Nadu. Shivaji had conquered important forts like Gingee and Vellore by 1678. Ekoji Bhonsle, the paternal half brother of Shivaji, established his own rule in Thanjavur. This particular Bhonsle dynasty ruled Thanjavur until 1855, when the kingdom was annexed by the British Raj.\nGingee served as the Maratha capital for nine years during the 27-year Mughal-Maratha war, starting after the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji. The Mughals captured Gingee in 1698.\n\n\n== Rule of Poligars, Nizams and Nawabs ==\nEuropean settlements began to appear in the Tamil country during the Vijayanagara Empire. In 1605, the Dutch established trading posts in the Coromandel Coast near Gingee and in Pulicat. The British East India Company built a 'factory' (warehouse) at Armagaon (Durgarazpatnam), a village around 35 miles (56 km) North of Pulicat, as the site in 1626. In 1639, Francis Day, one of the officers of the company, secured the rights over a three-mile (5 km) long strip of land a fishing village called Madraspatnam from the Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, the Nayak of Vandavasi. The East India Company built Fort St George and castle on an approximate five square kilometre sand strip. This was the start of the town of Madras. The coromandel coast was ruled by the Vijayanagara King (Aravidu Dynasty), Peda Venkata Raya, based in Chandragiri and Vellore Fort. With his approval the English began to exercise sovereign rights over their strip of land.\nDuring the Maratha rule of Thanjavur. After Ekoji, his three sons namely Shaji, Serfoji I, Thukkoji alias Thulaja I ruled Thanjavur. The greatest of the Maratha rulers was Serfoji II (1798‚Äì1832 ). Serfoji devoted his life to the pursuit of culture and Thanjavur became renowned as a seat of learning. Serfoji's patronised art and literature and built the Saraswati Mahal Library at his palace. The incursion of the Muslim armies from the north forced a southward migration of Hindus from the central Deccan and the Andhra countries to seek shelter under the Nayak and the Maratha kings. The famous Carnatic music composer Tyagaraja (1767‚Äì1847), along with the Trinity of Carnatic music flourished in the Thanjavur district during this time.\n\nWith the demise of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, his empire dissolved amidst numerous succession wars and the vassals of the empire began to assert their independence. The administration of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu was fragmented with hundreds of Polygars or Palayakkarars governing a few villages each. These local chieftains often fought amongst each other over territory. This turned the political situation in the Tamil country and in South India in general into confusion and chaos. The European traders found themselves in a situation where they could exploit the prevailing confusion to their own advantage.\n\n\n== European influences ==\n\n\n=== Anglo-French conflicts ===\n\nThe French were relative newcomers to India. The French East India Company was formed in 1664 and in 1666 the French representatives obtained Aurangzeb's permission to trade in India. The French soon set up trading posts at Pondicherry on the Coromandel coast. They occupied Karaikal in 1739 and Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix was appointed Governor of Pondich√©ry. In Europe the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740 and eventually the British and the French forces in India were caught up in the conflict. There were numerous naval battles between the two navies along the Coromandel coast. The French led by La Bourdonnais attacked the poorly defended Fort St. George in Madras in 1746 and occupied it. Robert Clive was one of the prisoners of war from this battle. The war in Europe ended in 1748 and with the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle Madras was restored to the British.\nThe conflict between the British and the French continued, this time in political rather than military terms. Both the Nawab of the Carnatic and Nizam of Hyderabad positions were taken by rulers who were strongly sympathetic to the French. Chanda Sahib had been made Nawab of the Carnatic with Dupleix's assistance, while the British had taken up the cause of the previous incumbent, Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah. In the resultant battle between the rivals, Clive assisted Mohammed Ali by attacking Chanda Sahib's fort in Arcot and took possession of it in 1751. The French assisted Chanda Sahib in his attempts to drive Clive out of Arcot. However, the large Arcot army assisted by the French was defeated by the British. The Treaty of Paris (1763) formally confirmed Mahommed Ali as the Nawab of the Carnatic. It was a result of this action and the increased British influence that in 1765 the Emperor of Delhi issued a firman (decree) recognising the British possessions in southern India.\n\n\n=== British Government control ===\n\nAlthough the company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was getting clearer day by day that the company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. Opinion amongst the members of the British Parliament urged the government to control the activities of the company. The company's financial position was also bad and it had to apply for a loan from Parliament. Seizing this opportunity, the Parliament passed the East India Company Act 1773  (13 Geo. 3. c. 63). The act set down regulations to control the company board and created the position of the Governor General. Warren Hastings was appointed the first Governor-General. In 1784 Pitt's East India Company Act 1784 (24 Geo. 3. Sess. 2. c. 25) made the company subordinate to the British Government.\nThe next few decades were of rapid growth and expansion in the territories controlled by the British. The Anglo-Mysore Wars of 1766 to 1799 and the Anglo-Maratha Wars of 1772 to 1818 put the Company in control of most of India. In a sign of the early resistance against the English control, the Palayakkarar chieftains of the old Madurai Kingdom, who had independent authority over their territories, ran into a conflict with the company officials over tax collection. Kattabomman, a local Palayakkarar chieftain in the Tirunelveli district, rebelled against the taxes imposed by the company administration in the 1790s. After the First Polygar War (1799‚Äì1802), he was captured and hanged in 1799. A year later, Oomaithurai continued the resistance against the East India Company. In the first Poligar war, he was captured and imprisoned in Palayamkottai Central Prison. In February 1801, he escaped and rebuilt the Panchalankurichi fort which had been razed in the first war. In the second Poligar war that followed, Oomaithurai allied himself with Maruthu brothers who ruled Sivagangai and was part of a grand alliance against the company which included Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Verma. The company forces led by Lt. Colonel Agnew laid siege to the Panchalankurichi fort and captured it in May 1801 after a prolonged siege and artillery bombardment. Oomaithurai escaped the fall of the fort and joined Marudu brothers at their jungle fort at Kalayar Kovil. The company forces pursued him there and eventually captured Kalayar Kovil in October 1801. Oomaithurai along with the Marudu brothers was hanged on 16 November 1801.\nIn 1798 Lord Wellesley became the Governor-General. In the course of the next six years, Wellesley made vast conquests and doubled the company's territory. He shut out the French from further acquisitions in India, destroyed several ruling powers in the Deccan and the Carnatic, took the Mughal Emperor under the company's protection and compelled Serfoji, the king of Thanjavur to cede control of his kingdom. The Madras Presidency was established so that the territory under direct company control could be administered effectively. The direct administration began to cause resentment among the people. In 1806 the soldiers of the Vellore cantonment rebelled when William Bentinck, the Governor of Madras decreed that the native soldiers should abandon all caste marks. Fearing this act to be an attempt of forceful conversion to Christianity, the soldiers mutinied. The rebellion was suppressed but 114 British officers were killed and several hundred mutineers executed. Bentinck was recalled in disgrace.\n\n\n=== End of Company rule ===\nThe simmering discontent in the various districts of the company territories exploded in 1857 into the Sepoy war. Although the rebellion had a huge impact on the state of the colonial power in India, Tamil Nadu was mostly unaffected by it. As a consequence of the war, the British Government enacted the Act of 1858 to abolish the powers of the Company and transfer the government to the Crown.\n\n\n== British rule (1858‚Äì1947) ==\n\nIn 1858 the British Crown assumed direct rule in India. During the early years, the government was autocratic in many ways. The opinion of Indians in their own affairs was not considered by Britain as important. However, in due course, the British Raj began to allow Indians participation in local government. Viceroy Ripon passed a resolution in 1882, which gave a greater and more real share in local government to the people. Further legislation such as the 1892 Indian councils Act and the 1909 \"Minto‚ÄìMorley Reforms\" eventually led to the establishment of the Madras Legislative Council. The non-cooperation movement started under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership led the British government to pass the Government of India Act (also known as Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms) of 1919. The first elections were held for the local assemblies in 1921.\n\nFailure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in a severe famine in the Madras Presidency during 1876‚Äì1877. The government and several charitable institutions organised relief work in the city and the suburbs. Funds were also raised from Europeans in India and overseas for the famine relief. Humanitarians such as William Digby wrote angrily about the woeful failure of the British administration to act promptly and adequately in response to the wholesale suffering caused by the famine. When the famine finally ended with the return of the monsoon in 1878, between three and five million people had perished. In response to the devastating effects of the famine, the government organised a Famine Commission in 1880 to define the principles of disaster relief. The government also instituted a famine insurance grant, setting aside 1.5 million Rupees. Other civic works such as canal building and improvements in roads and railway were also undertaken to minimise the effects of any future famines.\n\n\n=== Independence struggle ===\nThe growing desire for independence began to gradually gather pace in the country and its influence in Tamil Nadu generated a number of volunteers to the fight against the British colonial power in the struggle for Independence. Notable amongst these are Tiruppur Kumaran, who was born in 1904 in a small village near Erode. Kumaran lost his life during a protest march against the British. The location of the French colony of Pondich√©ry, offered a place of refuge for the fugitives freedom fighters trying to flee the British Police. Aurobindo was one such living in Pondicherry in 1910. The poet Subramania Bharati was a contemporary of Aurobindo. Bharathi wrote numerous poems in Tamil extolling the revolutionary cause. He also published the journal India from Pondicherry. Both Aurobindo and Bharathi were associated with other Tamil revolutionaries like V. O. Chidambaram Pillai. Tamils formed a significant percentage of the members of the Indian National Army (INA), founded by Subhas Chandra Bose to fight the British occupation in India. Lakshmi Sahgal from Tamil Nadu was a prominent leader in the INA's Rani of Jhansi Regiment.\nIn 1916 Dr. T. M. Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty released the Non-Brahmin Manifesto sowing the seeds for the Dravidian movements. During the 1920s, two movements focused mainly on regional politics began in Tamil Nadu. One was the Justice Party, which won the local legislative elections held in 1921. The Justice Party was not focused on the Indian independence movement, rather on local issues such as affirmative action for socially backward groups. The other main movement was the anti-religious, anti-Brahmin, Self-Respect Movement led by E. V. Ramasami. Further steps towards eventual self-rule were taken in 1935 when the British Government passed the All-India Federation Act of 1935. Fresh local elections were held and in Tamil Nadu the Congress party captured power defeating the Justice party. In 1938, Ramasami with C. N. Annadurai launched an agitation against the Congress ministry's decision to introduce the teaching of Hindi in schools.\n\n\n== Post Independence period ==\n\nThe trauma of the partition did not impact Tamil Nadu when India was granted Independence in 1947. There was no sectarian violence against various religions. There had always been an atmosphere of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between all religions in Tamil Nadu. Congress formed the first ministry in the Madras Presidency. C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) was the first Chief Minister. Madras Presidency was eventually reconstituted as Madras State. Following agitations for a separate Andhra state comprising the Telugu-speaking regions of the Madras state by Potti Sriramalu, the Indian Government decided to partition the Madras state. In 1953 Rayalaseema and the coastal Andhra regions became the new state of Andhra Pradesh and the Bellary district became part of the Mysore state. In 1956 south Kanara district was transferred to Mysore, the Malabar coastal districts became part of the new state of Kerala, and the Madras state assumed its present shape. The Madras state was named Tamil Nadu (literally The Land of Tamils or Tamil Country) in 1969.\nThe Sri Lankan Civil War during the 1970s and the 80s saw large numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing to Tamil Nadu. The plight of Tamil refugees caused a surge of support from most of the Tamil political parties. They exerted pressure on the Indian government to intercede with the Sri Lankan government on behalf of the Sri Lankan Tamilians. However, LTTE lost much of its support from Tamil Nadu following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on 21 May 1991 by an operative from Sri Lanka for the former prime minister's role in sending Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka to disarm the LTTE. \nThe east coast of Tamil Nadu was one of the areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, during which almost 8000 people died in the disaster. The sixth most populous state in the Indian Union, Tamil Nadu was the seventh-largest economy in 2005 among the states of India. The growing demands for skilled labour has caused increased number of educational institutions in Tamil Nadu. The widespread application of caste-based affirmative action caused the state to have 69% of all educational and employment vacancies to be reserved to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. Such caste-based reservations have huge public support in Tamil Nadu, with no popular protests organised against its implementation.\nSince the 1990s, Tamil Nadu has experienced significant economic growth, especially in the service sector, and has had significant increases in development indicators. Kalaiyarasan (2014) attributes this to the strong welfare measures implemented by successive state governments and a two-track focus on economic growth and grassroots development.\n\n\n=== Evolution of regional politics ===\nThe politics of Tamil Nadu have gone through three distinct phases since independence. The domination of the Congress Party after 1947 gave way to the Dravidian populist mobilization in the 1960s. This phase lasted until the end of the 1990s. The most recent phase saw the fragmentation of the Dravidian political parties and led to the advent of political alliances and coalition governments. Annadurai formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949 after splitting from Dravidar Kazhagam. DMK also decided to oppose the 'expansion of the Hindi culture' in Tamil Nadu and started the demand for a separate homeland for the Dravidians in the South. The demand was for an Independent state called Dravida Nadu (country of Dravidians) comprising Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala. The increased involvement of the Indian National Congress party in Madras during the late 1950s and the strong pan-Indian emotions whipped up by the Sino-Indian War in 1962 led to the demand for Dravida Nadu losing some of its immediacy. Consequently, in 1963, when the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of India, precluded secessionist parties from contesting elections, the DMK chose to formally drop its demand for an independent Dravida Nadu, focusing instead on securing greater functional autonomy within the framework of the Indian Constitution.\nThe Congress party, riding on the wave of public support stemming from the independence struggle, formed the first post-independence government in Tamil Nadu and continued to govern until 1967. In 1965 and 1968, DMK led widespread anti-Hindi agitations in the state against the plans of the Union Government to introduce Hindi in the state schools. Affirmative action in employment and educational institutions were pioneered in Tamil Nadu based on the demands of the Dravidian movement. The leadership of the Dravidian movement had very capable authors and literati in Annadurai and Karunanidhi, who assiduously utilised the popular media of stage plays and movies to spread its political messages. MG Ramachandran (MGR) who later became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, was one such stage and movie actor.\nIn 1967 DMK won the state election. DMK split into two in 1971, with MGR forming the splinter All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Since then these two parties have dominated the politics of Tamil Nadu. AIADMK, under MGR, retained control of the State Government over three consecutive assembly elections in 1977, 1980 and 1984. After MGR's death, AIADMK was split over the succession between various contenders. Eventually J. Jayalalithaa took over the leadership of AIADMK.\nSeveral changes to the political balance in Tamil Nadu took place during the later half of the 1990s, eventually leading to the end of the duopoly of DMK and AIADMK in the politics of Tamil Nadu. In 1996, a split in the Congress party in Tamil Nadu eventuated in the formation of Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC). TMC aligned with the DMK, while another party Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), which split from DMK aligned with the AIADMK. These and several smaller political parties began to gain popular support. The first instance of a 'grand alliance' was during the 1996 elections for the National parliament, during which the AIADMK formed a large coalition of a number of smaller parties to counter the electoral threat posed by the alliance between the DMK and TMC. Since then the formation of alliances of a large number of political parties has become an electoral practice in Tamil Nadu. The electoral decline of Congress party at the national level, which started during early 1990, forced the Congress to seek coalition partners from various states including Tamil Nadu. This paved the way for the Dravidian parties to be part of the Central Government.\nIn the 2001 elections, Jaylalithaa became Chief Minister again, but due to legal cases against her, the Chief Ministership was taken up by loyalist O. Paneerselvam until she returned 6 months later. In the 2006 assembly elections however, the DMK won a majority and Karunanidhi became chief minister. During the 2011 election however, the DMK was beset by anti-incumbency and anger over the 2G scam, and Jaylalithaa became Chief Minister again. Unlike the rest of India, the 2014 Lok Sabha elections resulted in no significant increase in support for the Bharatiya Janata Party in Tamil Nadu and the AIADMK swept the state. In 2016, Jaylalithaa won another term, but soon after taking office died of a heart attack. After her death, Paneerselvam served again as caretaker Chief Minister until he was expelled from the party by general secretary V. K. Sasikala. Then Edappadi Palaniswami, the newly-elected leader of the AIADMK legislature party, reached an agreement on chief ministership, and Palaniswami became chief minister in February 2017 with Paneerselvam as his deputy. In 2018, Karunanidhi died and was succeeded by his son M.K. Stalin as DMK leader and leader of the opposition. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK-led alliance swept the state winning 37 out of 38 seats. The alliance also won the 2021 Legislative Assembly election, with 159 out of 234 seats. As a result, M.K. Stalin became the Chief Minister.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChronology of Tamil history\nTamil inscriptions\nTamizhi\nTamil Heritage Foundation\nThe Tamils are an ancient people...\nPolitical history of medieval Karnataka\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nUnintended influence of Jainism on the development of caste in post-classical Tamil society Archived 18 January 2012 at the Wayback Machine",
      "summary": "The region of Tamil Nadu in the southeast of modern India, shows evidence of having had continuous human habitation from 15,000 BCE to 10,000 BCE. Throughout its history, spanning the early Upper Paleolithic age to modern times, this region has coexisted with various external cultures.\nThe three ancient Tamil dynasties namely Chera, Chola, and Pandya were of ancient origins. Together they ruled over this land with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in the world. These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other vying for hegemony over the land. Invasion by the Kalabhras during the 3rd century disturbed the traditional order of the land, displacing the three ruling kingdoms. These occupiers were overthrown by the resurgence of the Pandyas and the Pallavas, who restored the traditional kingdoms. The Cholas who re-emerged from obscurity in the 9th century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas rose to become a great power and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula. At its height the Chola empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km¬≤ (1,389,968 sq mi) straddling the Bay of Bengal. The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia.\nRapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest and the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the 14th century. Despite this, the Vijayanagara Empire gained a foothold in the region from the late 14th century until the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha Empire expanded its territories into the northern regions of present-day Tamil Nadu. The Madras Presidency, comprising most of southern India, was created in the late 18th century and was ruled directly by the British. After the independence of India, after the Telugu and Malayalam parts of Madras state were separated from Tamilagam state in 1956, it was renamed as Tamil Nadu on January 14, 1969, by the state government.\n\n",

      "title": "Indian Army atrocities in Northeast India",
      "content": "The Indian Army has been actively involved in Northeast India‚Äîa region comprising Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura‚Äîprimarily to address insurgencies and maintain order. However, several allegations and documented instances of human rights violations have emerged over the years\n\n\n== Background ==\nNortheast India has experienced various insurgent movements since India's independence, with groups demanding autonomy or independence based on ethnic and cultural identities. To counter these movements, the Indian government deployed the army and enacted laws like the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in 1958, granting special powers to the military in \"disturbed areas.\" Critics argue that AFSPA has led to human rights abuses due to the immunity it provides to security forces.\nHuman rights organizations and local communities have reported instances of extrajudicial killings, torture, sexual violence, and arbitrary detentions by the Indian Army in Northeast India. The AFSPA has been particularly contentious, with claims that it facilitates impunity for such actions.\n\n\n== Allegations of violence ==\nSexual violence in Northeast India has been a significant concern, with numerous allegations against security forces, including the Indian Army. The enforcement of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) has been criticized for enabling such abuses by providing immunity to military personnel.\n\n\n=== Notable cases of sexual violence ===\n\n\n==== Thangjam Manorama Case (2004) ====\nIn July 2004, Thangjam Manorama, a 32-year-old woman from Manipur, was arrested by Assam Rifles personnel on suspicion of being associated with insurgent groups. The following day, her body was found bearing signs of torture and sexual assault. This incident led to widespread protests, including a notable demonstration by Manipuri women who protested naked in front of the Assam Rifles headquarters, demanding justice and the repeal of AFSPA. This also led to activism by Irom Sharmila, who started a fast demanding the repeal of AFSPA.\n\n\n==== Rape of Naga Women in Oinam (1987) ====\nIn July 1987, following an attack by Naga insurgents on an Assam Rifles post in Oinam, Manipur, a retaliatory operation named \"Operation Bluebird\" was launched. During this operation, there were reports of widespread human rights violations, including the rape of Naga women by security forces. Despite documentation by human rights organizations, justice for the victims remains elusive.\n\n\n==== Allegations in Assam and Tripura ====\nReports from Assam and Tripura have documented instances where women, particularly from tribal communities, have been subjected to sexual violence by security forces during counter-insurgency operations. For example, in Tripura, opposition members alleged in 1989 that there had been numerous cases of rape by security forces in the preceding months. Such incidents have contributed to a pervasive fear among women in these regions.\nThe rape and murder of Miss Luingamla Muinao occurred on January 24, 1986, in Ngainga village, Ukhrul district, Manipur, India. Captain Mandhir Singh of the 25 Madras Regiment and 2nd Lt Sanjeev Dubey of the Mahar Regiment visited the village for patrolling ahead of Republic Day celebrations. While Luingamla Muinao was alone in her house, the two soldiers entered and attempted to assault her. She resisted and thus was fatally shot by Captain Mandhir Singh.\nThe incident led to widespread outrage across Manipur. A large public meeting was held at Ukhrul Tangkhul Long Ground with Luingamla's body, followed by a significant rally in Imphal on March 11, 1986. The rally was supported by various valley-based organizations, and it was resolved that March 11 would be observed as \"Unity Day\" to symbolize solidarity between the hill and valley communities of Manipur.\nLuingamla's neighbor, Zamthingla Ruivah, who witnessed the killing, designed a special fanek (traditional wraparound skirt) called \"Luingamla Kashan\" in her memory.\n\n\n== Commission Reports and Findings ==\n\n\n=== Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy Committee (2005) ===\nIn 2004, following widespread protests over the alleged rape and murder of Thangjam Manorama by Assam Rifles personnel in Manipur, the Government of India established a committee led by Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy to review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). The committee's report, submitted in 2005, recommended the repeal of AFSPA, describing it as \"a symbol of oppression\" and suggesting that its provisions could be incorporated into existing laws. However, the report was not made public immediately, and its recommendations were not implemented.\n\n\n=== National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Observations ===\nThe NHRC has addressed several cases involving the armed forces in Northeast India. For instance, in 1994‚Äì1995, the NHRC took cognizance of alleged killings of civilians in Ukhrul Town, Manipur, during crossfiring between the 20 Assam Rifles and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). Such interventions by the NHRC underscore the ongoing concerns regarding human rights violations in the region.\n\n\n== Government Responses ==\nIn response to these reports and public outcry, the Indian government has occasionally set up inquiries and, in some instances, withdrawn AFSPA from certain areas. For example, in April 2022, the government announced the partial repeal of AFSPA from parts of the Northeast, citing improved security situations. However, debates continue over the act's necessity and its implications for human rights.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "content": "Jhatyapali was the princess of Deogiri and a daughter of Rai Ramchandra Dev, the ruler of Deogiri. She was later married to Alauddin Khalji and her son Shihabuddin Omar  was appointed as the successor of Alauddin, after his death.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn a bid to fulfil his desire of territorial expansion, Alauddin first raided Deogiri in 1296. The Deogiri at the time of his raid was ruled by Rai Ramchandra, the Yadava ruler, with his son Shankardeo as the supreme commander of the Yadava army. Shankardeo was on an expeditionary mission during Alauddin's invasion and Ramchandra was not able to withstand the invading army from Delhi. Though Yadava gave formidable challenge to Alauddin they were not able to cope up with the situation due to absence of Shankardeo from the battlefield. Ramchandra then sent a message of truce, which was welcomed by Alauddin as he wanted to return Delhi as soon as possible.\nThey came to an agreement in which a large amount of wealth along with precious gifts were given to Alauddin as war indemnity. Ramchandra Dev also promised to pay annual tribute to him, which made the treaty possible. After his return to the Deogiri, Shankardeo came to know about the derogatory peace treaty with Delhi and he pressed his father to stop paying tribute in a bid to express his independence from the subordination.\nThe failure of Ramchandra to pay the annual tribute dragged Alauddin's attention to the Deogiri once again. After his successful expeditions of Chittor and Malwa, Alauddin was compelled to send two armies to Deogiri for a second showdown. This time Yadavas were routed; as the combined forces of Delhi, one which was sent to displace Rai Karana Singh Vaghela, the Rajput ruler of Gujarat, who was defeated earlier by Alauddin and was seeking refuse at Baglana on the border of south Gujarat and another particularly for Deogiri campaign under Malik Kafur pushed their way into Yadava's territory.\nIn this treaty Allauddin also asked for Raja Ramchandra's daughter Jyeshthapalli (Jyethai) which Ramchandra agreed to.\n\n\n== Life as Empress ==\nShihabuddin Omar,  the son of Jhatyapali, who was merely six years old was appointed by Malik Kafur, the slave General of Alauddin as his successor while the other sons of Alauddin including Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah  were either blinded or detained. This was done by Kafur to strengthen his holds upon the Sultanate.\nAccording to Ferishta, in order to legitimise his rule Malik Kafur married Jhatyapali and became the step-father of the boy Sultan. The fate  of Alauddin's family engineered by Kafur to fulfill his ambitions was not liked by some of the earlier nobles and bodyguards (Paiks) of Alauddin, who plotted and assassinated Kafur, which was followed by freeing of Mubarak Shah, another adult son of Alauddin.\nMubarak Shah took over the affairs of state in his hand as the regent and for some time his younger brother Shihabuddin was restored as the Sultan. After working as regent for some time, Mubarak complained that Jhatyapali, the queen mother had conspired to poison him and taking it as pretext, he sent Shihabuddin as prisoner to Gwalior,  where  he was blinded but no step was taken against Jhatyapali.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn 1320, Khusrau Khan, the General and partner of homosexual Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Shah, raised the army of Baradus, a Hindu military clan. He assassinated Sultan and in order to eliminate all the possible claimants to the throne, he attacked the royal harem. All the surviving princes were ordered to be killed. Jhayatapali, the mother of Mubarak Shah was also killed during the Coup.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "title": "Kampana's invasion of Madurai",
      "content": "Kumara Kampana, son of Bukka I of the Vijayanagara Empire, commanded a series of military campaigns that disestablished Muslim rule in southern India, annexing Madurai around 1370 CE. His conquests restored social order, revived religious practices, and extended the Vijayanagara's dominion to the Southern Ocean. Kampana's conquests, such as the reconstruction of the Ranganatha temple and the liberation of Ma'bar, are enshrined in the Sanskrit epic Madhura Vijayam by his wife, Ganga Devi.\n\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nIbn Battuta, the Moorish traveler, was in Madurai in 1342 CE and documented the nascent history of the Madurai Sultanate. Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan, the founder of the Sultanate, died in 1340 CE after five years of reign. He was succeeded by Ala-ud-din Udaiji, who reigned for approximately a year before being assassinated. Udaiji's son-in-law, Qutb-ud-din, seized power for a short period but was assassinated after merely forty days. The throne was then occupied by Ghiyas-ud-din Dhamaghani (1341‚Äì43 CE), during whose reign Ibn Battuta was in Madurai.\n\nIn Ghiyas-ud-din's reign, the Hoysala king Veera Ballala III invaded, defeating the Sultanate forces in the battle of Kannanur and besieging Kobban fort for six months. Ghiyas-ud-din, however, made a surprise counterattack, capturing and killing Veera Ballala III in 1342 CE. Ibn Battuta, who saw these happenings, remarked on the Sultan's tyrannical rule. An epidemic swept Madurai at this time, ultimately killing the Sultan. His nephew, Nasir-ud-din, succeeded to power in 1343‚Äì44 CE, just before Ibn Battuta departed the area.\n\nThe later history of the Sultanate is poorly documented, and the interval of a break in coinage between 1343 and 1356 CE points to instability. Historian Afif states that during Sultan Feroz Shah's rule at Delhi, a firman dispatched to Ma'bar found the place rulerless. According to reports, the local people chose Qurbat Hasan Kangu as the king, but he was ineffective. Meanwhile, the founding of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1336 CE marked the beginning of resistance to Muslim rule in the Deccan and southern India, ultimately resulting in the downfall of the Madurai Sultanate.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring Bukka's rule, a typical milestone was the fall of the Madurai Sultanate at the hands of his son, Kumara Kampana. After making peace after the siege of Vijayanagara, Bukka followed his plans to conquer South India, motivated by a series of compelling reasons. The region, earlier under the Hoysala Kingdom, had fallen into anarchy due to internecine wars among native chiefs, threatening life and property. Also, the Madurai Sultanate was a thorn in the flesh of Hindu culture, and desecrated temples and destroyed religious centers called for a savior. Bukka wanted to fulfill Ballala's incomplete task of reconquest and restoration.\n\nAccording to Bukka's orders, Kampana, the viceroy of the southern provinces, launched a series of military campaigns to establish Vijayanagara's dominance. With the help of great generals like Gopana and Suva Mangu (who is said to be Mangappa Dandanatha, an ancestor of Saluva Narasinga), he conquered the Sambuvarayas of North and South Arcot first, making them loyal to the greater cause.\n\nKampana then marched further into Tondamandala, which was controlled by Sambava Raya, or Champa Raya. He set up Virinchipuram as his headquarters and then besieged and occupied Sambava Raya's fortress after he won a duel. Following this victory, Kampana marched on Kanchi, where he granted magnificent benefactions to local temples and left a garrison to offer public security. He then marched further south to invade the Madurai Sultanate.\n\n\n== Conquest of Madurai ==\nKumara Kampana, grandson of Bukka I, the second Vijayanagara king, orchestrated a sequence of victorious campaigns that resulted in the gradual erosion of Muslim dominance across southern India. His occupation of Rajagambhira Rajya, the kingdom of the Sambuvarayas, around 1362 CE was the beginning of his southward military campaigns. Following this victory, Kampana marched further south and restored the image of God Ranganatha to his temple at Srirangam, which had been taken away for safety during the Muslim invasions.\n\nThe peak of Kampana's military campaigns was his conquest of Madurai, where he defeated the Sultan decisively, effectively ending almost five decades of Muslim rule in the area.  This military campaign not only expanded Vijayanagara's dominance across southern India but also brought peace, restored religious practices, and refurbished cultural institutions, thereby leaving an indelible mark in the region's historical record.\n\nThe Sanskrit epic Madhura Vijayam, written by his wife Ganga Devi, recounts that Kampana was inspired by a divine vision in Kanchipuram. In this vision, the god who represented the Pandya land lamented the fate of the land under Muslim rule and gave him a sword that symbolized Pandyan rule. This event, which occurred between 1365 and 1370 CE, marked the freedom of Ma'bar from Muslim rule.\n\nAfter the fall of Madurai, Kampana continued his march south to Ramnad and Rameswaram, where he restored temples and ensured their proper worship. By 1371 CE, his military conquests had extended to the southern ocean. In spite of a failed appeal for help from the defeated Muslims to Delhi, Kampana consolidated the Vijayanagara hegemony over the region.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDuring the next two years, Kampana devoted himself to the reorganization of the administration in the south, ensuring stability before returning to Mulbagal in 1373 CE to complete his military campaigns. His efforts not only ended Muslim rule in the south but also restored Hindu religious practices and consolidated Vijayanagara's power in the region. Kampana died in 1374 CE, leaving a lasting legacy celebrated in the Madhura Vijayam.\nThe conquest of south India is one of the greatest achievements in the history of Vijayanagara Empire, elevating what had been a small principality to the status of an empire. Bukka I celebrated this great success by adopting the titles of  \"King of Kings\" and \"Lord of Three Seas.\" Besides, he sent an embassy to the Chinese Emperor, Tai-tsu, further consolidating the grandeur of his empire. The capital, Vidyanagara, was renamed Vijayanagara, or \"City of Victory,\" as a memorial of Bukka's great conquests. \n\nAlongside the political advancements, the Vijayanagara Empire experienced a flourishing of religious and literary activity prospered at the capital. Under the patronage of King Bukka I and inspired by him, Vidyaranya made unprecedented efforts in reviving religious studies, religiously transcending. He attracted scholars from far and wide and provided them with endowments and facilities to write on various subjects like logic, grammar, astronomy, philosophy, and Vedic theology.\n\nThe volume of learned work done under his patronage became renowned in all of India. Some of the important works of that period are Sarvadarsana Sangraha, Sankara Digvijaya, Parasara Madhaveeya, Manusmruti VyƒÅkhyƒÅna, Jaimineeya-Dhaluvritti, Vinarana Prameya, Vedanta Panchadashi, Desopanishad Deepika, VyavahƒÅra MƒÅdhava and various stotras. Vidyaranya's brother, Sayanacharya, was equally great a scholar, contributing more than 113 works.\nSome of his important works are SubhƒÅshita SudhƒÅnidhi, AlankƒÅra SudhƒÅnidhi, Kaivalyopanishad DeepikƒÅ, Dattaka MeemƒÅmsa PancharudriyƒÅtaka and Panineeya-ShikshƒÅ-ShƒÅshya. Bhojanatha also contributed some important works including Maha Ganapathi Stotra, RƒÅmollƒÅsa, Tripura Vijaya, Sringdra Manjari, Vashama-Mala and Govinda Sataka. Vidyaranya and Sayanacharya also oversaw commentaries on the four Vedas, the Brahmanas, and many other sacred works.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMadurai Sultanate\nList of wars involving India\nBukka I\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",
