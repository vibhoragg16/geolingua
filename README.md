A geographic-aware language model that adapts its responses based on regional linguistic patterns, cultural references, and local knowledge using Group-based Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) techniques.

</div>

📝 Overview
GeoLingua is an open-source project designed to understand and generate text appropriate to specific geographic regions. It moves beyond generic language models by incorporating local dialects, cultural references, and regional knowledge. The model uses Group-based Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune responses for different geographic contexts, ensuring more natural and contextually-aware interactions.

✨ Features
Geographic Adaptation: Adapts language style based on the target geographic context.

Cultural Awareness: Incorporates regional cultural references, slang, and local knowledge.

GRPO Training: Uses Group-based Reward Policy Optimization for fine-tuning, a novel approach to steer the model's behavior.

Multi-source Data Collection: Gathers data from diverse sources like Reddit, news articles, and Wikipedia to build robust regional profiles.

Supported Regions: Pre-trained models for a variety of English-speaking regions.

Interactive Demo: A web-based interface built with Streamlit for easy testing and demonstration.

Extensible: Designed to be easily extended with new regions and data sources.

🌏 Supported Regions
United States (South): Southern dialects, cultural references, and local knowledge.

United Kingdom: British English, cultural context, and regional variations.

Australia: Australian English, slang, and cultural references.

India: Indian English variations and cultural context.

Nigeria: Nigerian English and cultural references.

⚙️ Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

Git

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/vibhoragg16/geolingua.git](https://github.com/vibhoragg16/geolingua.git)
cd geolingua

Create and activate a virtual environment:

Linux/macOS:

python3 -m venv geolingua_env
source geolingua_env/bin/activate

Windows:

python -m venv geolingua_env
geolingua_env\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install in development mode (recommended for contributors):

pip install -e .

🚀 Quick Start
Follow these steps to collect data, train a model, and run the demo.

Data Collection:
Collect data for a specific region from a source like Reddit.

python scripts/collect_data.py --region us_south --source reddit

Training: Train the model using kaggle and for more detail refer KAGGLE_GUIDE.md 

python kaggle_train.py

Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of your trained model.

python evaluate_model.py

Run the Interactive Demo:
Launch the Streamlit demo to interact with your model.

streamlit run demo/app.py

🔧 Configuration
Model, training, and data parameters can be easily modified in the config/ directory:

config/model_config.py: Controls model architecture, learning rates, and other training settings.

config/data_config.py: Manages data collection sources, preprocessing steps, and paths.
